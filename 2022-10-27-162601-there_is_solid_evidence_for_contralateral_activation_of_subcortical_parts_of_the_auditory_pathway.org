#+title: There is solid evidence for contralateral activation of subcortical parts of the auditory pathway

From [cite:@lehmannDissociatedLateralizationTransient2007], citing  Langers et al., 2005; Melcher et al., 2000; Scheonwiesner et al., 2007; Boyen et al., 2014

"Previous studies of subcortical activation with monaural stimuli: all of them found strong contralateral activation in [[id:20221020T111200.383236][IC]] and [[id:20221020T140117.811499][MGB]], but different degrees of ipsilateral activation."
