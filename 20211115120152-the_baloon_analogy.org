#+title: the balloon analogy

We can think of the state of mind we've achieved at the end of a meditation session like a balloon we've worked hard to inflate - and we can choose to keep it inflated when we get up from sitting, we don't have to let all the air go out of it. We can choose to keep walking around with that state of mind for the next walking meditation session, or the rest of the day.

Also useful to think about this image when recalling our insight [[id:20211115T115959.189104][we can and should recall our insights]].
