#+TITLE: Markov blanket
A markov blanket is a statistical construct used to define something, anything, that has an "inside" and an "outside".

The boundary between inside and out is the Markov blanket - it separates the world into states that are internal to the system, that belong to it, and those that are external to it.

"the system" can be anything - it's an abstraction - a cell, the brain, a culture, this planet etc. at any scale

The blanket has two faces - internal and external - and is comprised of "states"

*** *sensory states* influence internal states (= stated of the system) but not the outside world. they mediate information about the world to the system.
*** *active states* are  the other way around - they are dependent on internal states of the system, but not by the outside world. they influence external states (=states of the world outside).
