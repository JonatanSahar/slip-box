#+TITLE: Quantum field theory
#+ROAM_ALIAS:*** the whole idea of the electron and the two quarks being the basic building blocks of all matter in the universe has been long known in physics to be just untrue

*** the basic stuff the universe is made of is fields - rippling in all sorts of ways
*** fields are spread all through the universe, and have a certain value at each point in time
*** quantum mechanics: energy isn't continuous in the universe, it has to come bundled up into little lumps
*** light waves are not as continuous as we might think - they're actuall bundled up as photons
*** in the same way - electrons are bundles of energy that are ripples in the *electron field* - all electrons are actually connected, like waves are connected through being made of the same body of water
*** and the same for quarks
*** quantum fluctuations in vaccum, the fields can't stay still (heisenberg principal) , they have been experimentally verified
*** there are 4 basic kinds of particles: electrons, the two quarks and the neutrino
*** and there are 3 "variants" of each of these: the "regular" and two heavier ones.
*** so 12 matter-fields all in all
*** there are also 4 forces and associated force-fields: gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong & weak nuclear forces.
*** the field behind gravity is space-time itself (this is the punchline of general relativity)
