#+TITLE: Rich-club effect

Is an attribute of network topology in which high-degree nodes (or hubs) are
also highly connected between themselves.
The rich-club coeficient measures the degree to which this exists in a given
graph, and it's value is roughly equal to:
(# of edges between nodes of degree> (some chosen parameter) k)/# of edges between those nodes that would exist in a full graph.
