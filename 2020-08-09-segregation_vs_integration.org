#+TITLE: segregation vs integration
cite:zhao19_graph_theor_model_baby_brain_networ refer to two aspects of network
organization:
 - segregation: a measure of the ability of a localized area to perform
   computations. It's influenced by the degree of interconnectedness inside
   clusters (see [[file:2020-08-09-modularity_in_the_developing_brain.org][modularity in the developing brain]])

  - integration: the efficiency of the network as a whole, the path length between
    nodes in different areas, the ability to transfer information between
    different remote areas.
    Developed integration is characterized by short average shortest-path, also
    known as high [[file:2020-08-05-network_efficiency.org][network efficiency]]
    [[file:2020-08-03-rich_club_effect.org][Rich-club effect]] is a hallmark of high integration, since it facilitates
    shorter paths between member nodes of remote modules/clusters

    [[file:2020-07-28-small_world_networks.org][small world networks]] are a good balance of segregation and integration
