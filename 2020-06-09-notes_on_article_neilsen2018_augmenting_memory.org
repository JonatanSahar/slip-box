* general remarks

  - reading in depth: a few passes, at each stage ankify only easy to understand
  concepts and facts. then a couple of in depth reads.
  - ankify at least 5 questions per article even for shallow reads.
  - add questions from both directions of a fact (who said X about Y? also what
    did A say about Y?) 
  - include questions that question the validity if the facts/clains/findings/
    analysis. add the name of the researcher/year, add questions about what
    makes a particular analysis hard to make (accurately).
  - add figures as questions
  - get into the habit of not reading all the way through, not getting deeper if
    it doesn't feel worth it/if it feels like there's more value in reading
    something else. 
  - to get into a new field it's much better to interact deeply with a few key
    papers than with much of everything.  

* patterns of use

  - make most questions as atomic as possible
    - break down more complicated questions that are hard to remember
  - make your own decks
  - build hierarchies of questions
  - create interconnections
