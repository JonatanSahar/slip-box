#+TITLE: hubs are areas of vulnerability in the fetal/infant brain
since [[file:2020-08-04-hubs_are_more_critical_in_the_infant_brain.org][hubs are more critical in the infant brain]], they're also potentially
"points of failure" in the network (see [[file:2020-08-04-the_brain_as_a_network_graph.org][the brain as a network/graph]]). If
something goes wrong in their development, if they're malformed in some way etc.
this may lead to psychological and neurological problems later on in life - and
there is evidence to support this claim (referenced in cite:heuvel18_hubs_human_fetal_brain_networ)
