* A major debate is between "localist" and "prefrontalist" views for what is needed for consciousness (in addition to sensory info).

Localists say that local processing of the sensory information is generally sufficient, while prefrontalists argue that consciousness depends on some higher level functions (i.e integration or representation), which are dependent on the [[file:2021-05-20-pfc.org][PFC]].

* Three main ideas, all probably parts of some whole,  since [[file:2021-06-20-all_models_are_wrong_but_some_are_useful.org][All models are wrong, but some are useful]]:
***** global availability of information
***** recurrence (feedback loops, reverberation)
***** higher order representations
