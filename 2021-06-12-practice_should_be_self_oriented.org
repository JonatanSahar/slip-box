#+TITLE: Practice should be self-oriented

[[file:2021-06-12-amatuers_have_more_fun.org][Amatuers have more fun]], part of it is because they don;t care so much about success and failure, and measuring up to some standard.
This doesn't mean not having goals withing our practice, but the practice itself should be directed inwards, at myself, at my sense of improvement and change, and at my enjoyment of what I do. Have smaller goals, be less attached to them.
