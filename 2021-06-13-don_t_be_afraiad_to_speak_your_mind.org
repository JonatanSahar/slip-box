#+TITLE: Don't be afraiad to speak your mind
- source :: aeon

Being able to reason well - to clarify to myself what I think about something, to think it through is an important aspect of living a fulfilled, full life - it's not worth giving up on it for fear of losing social status or feeling not a part of my millieue.

And since [[file:2021-06-13-thinking_resoning_is_collaborative_by_nature.org][Thinking (resoning) is collaborative by nature]] I really should be less afraid of speaking my mind - that's the only way to grow and become better at thinking.
