#+TITLE: ANOVA

= ANalysis Of VAriance is a type of statistical hypothesis testing (i.e. vs a
null hypothesis).
It's often used to determine whether a division of the population (=data points)
into groups is statistically significant and as such - the null hypothesis is
that all samples belong to the same distribution (group)

ANOVA controls for the magnitude of false positives (type I errors) - this is
the p-value given by the test: the confidence level in that the difference
between the groups is _not_ due to chance.
We still need to account for type II ([[file:2020-09-07-false_negative.org][False Negative]])

It can be used as an exploratory tool (TODO: how?)
