#+TITLE: False Negative
Also known as type II errors in statistics.
It is largely dependant on:
- sample size (the rate is larger for smaller samples)
- significance level (when the standard of proof is high the chances of
  overlooking a discovery are also high)
- effect size (a smaller effect size is more prone to Type II error).
