A convolution is a mathematical operation whereby a kernel function "operates" on different areas of a given function/object in sequence.
Mathematically it's defined as:

In practice, it means the value of the convolution at point $x_1$ is the sum of products of the kernel $g(\tau)$ (where its nonzero) by $f(x)$, with $g(\tau)$ shifted to $x_1$.

In image processing for example, different kernels can "detect" different kinds of features in an image, and the convolution can also be thought of as copying the kernel based on a template given by the original image.

E.g. Diagonal detection (bottom left-top right):
