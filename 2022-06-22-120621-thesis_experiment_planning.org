* Previous work/motivation
*** Reznik 2014: single hand playing piano in the MRI scanner, binaural feedback
         a. *stronger modulation* of contralateral auditory cortex relative to playing hand (in active > passive condition)
              a. accordingly - *lower (=better) hearing threshold* in the ear ipsilateral to the playing hand (so the auditory cortex is contralateral)
         b. during the task, the contralateral audiory cortex had the strongest *functional connectivity* (across the brain) to the motor cortex

*** Buaron 2020: same sensory (visual) consequence for different motor actions (right/left button press)
         a. sensory modulation of self generated actions is dependent on laterality : *stronger modulation in the ipsilateral condition* (motor and visual cortex in the same hemisphere)
         b. possible to *decode the operating hand from the activity* in the visual cortex.

*** Dery (2022? In process): behavioral task, learning a single hand piano sequence with monaural feedback
         a. *better learning* in left hand contralateral condition
         b. *better cross education* for left hand contralateral condition  (right hand learning from left)

** Design

***  Localizers:
    - Two localizers:
        + motor only
        + auditory only

    - One run each. (*question:* is it enough trials?)

***  Block design and timings
  - An 8 seconds fixation break between blocks for signal washout
  - 2 seconds instruction slide
  - 4 runs - divided by ear. 2 x LE, 2 x RE
  - 20 blocks each =  5 of each ear/hand combo, 10 ipsi 10 contra per run.
  - 320 sec (~5.333) minutes per experiment run
  -
  - 7 runs, experiment run time (total 2240 sec ~38.5min):

  - anatomical scan etc. (total 7.5 min):
      - localizer 0:25
      - spin echo field map: 0:49
      - T2 1:42
      - T1 4:26
  - total time in scanner: 46min (without spare time for talking and rest between runs)





* Conditions
    - subjects will be playing the keyboard inside the MRI scanner
    - Blocks of RH-RE RH-LE LH-RE LH-LE
    - In each block participants will be asked to play twice in a row at their own pace
        + limited to 8 seconds

* Analysis
*** GLM
- Compare the activation in the auditory cortex between ipsi and contra hand playing. Separately for each ear
    - RH-LE > RH-RE
    - LH-RE > LH-LE
    - *question*: should we look at the reversed contrast as well?

*** MVPA
    - Decode hand from auditory cortex.
            Do this twice: once for the stimulated ear (cortex), once for the unstimulated ear.
    - cross-decoding: per each neighborhood train a classifier on the the condiiton where the ear is stimulated and test on the unstimulated ear.
    - cross-decoding: train on stimulated ear, test on ooppoidte ear wj

*** functional connectivity (PPI?)
    - Compare (task) functional connectivity between ipsi and contra hands per ear.
        + *question*: of course there will be a correlation in activity between motor and auditory cortex, because the both operate at the timing of key presses - how to deal with this?



* Special notes
- *arm length* must be *at least* 55cm shoulder to wrist, and 75cm eye-line to wrist height along the thigh.
- we don't want subjects with any experience playig the pian (so they won't have expectation about the order of the notes)
- לוודא שהם לא במהלך ניסוי אחר, ולא 3 חודשים מניסוי קודם
