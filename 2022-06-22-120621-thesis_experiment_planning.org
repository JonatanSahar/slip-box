* Previous work/motivation
*** Reznik 2014: single hand playing piano in the MRI scanner, binaural feedback
         a. *stronger modulation* of contralateral auditory cortex relative to playing hand (in active > passive condition)
              a. accordingly - *lower (=better) hearing threshold* in the ear ipsilateral to the playing hand (so the auditory cortex is contralateral)
         b. during the task, the contralateral audiory cortex had the strongest *functional connectivity* (across the brain) to the motor cortex

*** Buaron 2020: same sensory (visual) consequence for different motor actions (right/left button press)
         a. sensory modulation of self generated actions is dependent on laterality : *stronger modulation in the ipsilateral condition* (motor and visual cortex in the same hemisphere)
         b. possible to *decode the operating hand from the activity* in the visual cortex.

*** Dery (2022? In process): behavioral task, learning a single hand piano sequence with monaural feedback
         a. *better learning* in left hand contralateral condition
         b. *better cross education* for left hand contralateral condition  (right hand learning from left)

** Design

***  Localizers:
    - Two localizers:
        + motor only
        + auditory only

    - One run each. (*question:* is it enough trials?)

***  Block design and timings
  - An 8 seconds fixation break between blocks for signal washout
  - 2 seconds instruction slide
  - 4 runs - divided by ear. 2 x LE, 2 x RE
  - 20 blocks each =  5 of each ear/hand combo, 10 ipsi 10 contra per run.
  - *368 sec (~6 minutes)* per experiment run
  - 8 runs, experiment run time (*total 25602944 sec = 49 min*):

  - anatomical scan etc. (total 7.5 min):
      - localizer 0:25
      - spin echo field map: 0:49
      - T2 1:42
      - T1 4:26
  - *total time in scanner: 57 min* (without spare time for talking and rest between runs)

* Conditions
    - subjects will be playing the keyboard inside the MRI scanner
    - Blocks of RH-RE RH-LE LH-RE LH-LE
    - In each block participants will be asked to play twice in a row at their own pace
        + limited to 8 seconds

* Analysis
Basically, it's an exploratory analysis. We're looking for differences between hands in various ROis along the auditory pathway (thalamus, olivary nucleus, A1/2 etc.). We'll continue based on the results that we have.

We'll talk about the functional connectivity analysis after we have the data and some functional analyses done. We don't need to change the experiment to support it.

We need a lot of coverage in the scan (a lot of slices) so we'll have data from subcortical parts as well.

How about the cerebellum?

We can consider DTI based on the length of the pilot - we don't have anyone to analyse it at the moment anyways.

*** GLM
- Compare the activation in the auditory cortex between ipsi and contra hand playing. Separately for each ear
    - RH-LE > RH-RE
    - LH-RE > LH-LE

*** MVPA
    - Decode hand from auditory cortex.
        + once decoding from the stimulated ear (cortex)
        + once decoding from the unstimulated ear.
    - cross-decoding: train on stimulated ear, test on oposite ear
    - we can't "cross decode" betewen hemispheres because the order of the voxels in the neighborhood matters (it's the order of the features in the vector the classifier learns) and the homology betewen the L and R hemispheres is no where near exact enough.

*** functional connectivity (PPI?)
    - Compare (task) functional connectivity between ipsi and contra hands per ear.
        + *question*: of course there will be a correlation in activity between motor and auditory cortex, because the both operate at the timing of key presses - how to deal with this?



* Special notes
- *arm length* must be *at least* 55cm shoulder to wrist, and 75cm eye-line to wrist height along the thigh.
- we don't want subjects with any experience playig the pian (so they won't have expectation about the order of the notes)
- לוודא שהם לא במהלך ניסוי אחר, ולא 3 חודשים מניסוי קודם
