#+TITLE: Writing zettels should be fun

It should be playful, and it should feel meaningful to me. It's not about what
it looks/reads like, it shouldn't look like the examples I see online. It
should be personal. It should be written for my eyes only, I needs to have the
certainty that only I would ever see it, so I can be free to make mistakes, and
make it *personal*. It's about how it feels for me to write a piece of myself
out into the world.
