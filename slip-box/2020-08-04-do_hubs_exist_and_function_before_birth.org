#+TITLE: do hubs exist and function before birth?
cite:heuvel18_hubs_human_fetal_brain_networ seem to claim they do function, but
I wasn't convinced.
Their idea was "attacking" a model of the network and they show a 2% difference,
which is a 14% decrease in network efficiency when removing a hub node as
opposed to a general node.

Also it unclear in which way they actually "function" - do they just
transmit/propagate random firings? do they "coordinate" activity or integration
of stimuli in some way?
