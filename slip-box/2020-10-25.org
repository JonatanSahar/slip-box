*** the first experiment was *with awareness:*
***** used a 2x2 grid: congruous/incongruous x intact/scrambled

:END:

***** saw N300 for intact/scrambled - basic object identification
***** saw N400 for congruent/incongruous - semantic understanding, integration effort of surprising information

*** the 2nd experiment was *without awareness*:
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       0b350a58-2127-4a4b-9752-ceea741e5798
:END:

***** wanted to find semantic processing sans awareness
***** no N400 found - i.e. no evidence of semantic processing
***** N300 found - but in opposite direction: stronger for intact objects.
******* possible explanations:
********* it's so far from looking like an object that it doesn't even evoke the mechanisms for object identification
********* it's *(what is? the response to intact object?)* a false positive result (artifact) that doesn't represent an actual process
