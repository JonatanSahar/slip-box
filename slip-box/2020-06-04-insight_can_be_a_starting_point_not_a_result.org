#+TITLE: Insight can be a starting point not a result
- source :: dharma talk by Rob Burbea

Usually we think about insight as something we get to as result of practice.
Actually, we sometimes have little pieces of insight in our lives right now -
something we did or a way of thought that that made us feel better (= less [[file:2020-06-04-dukhaa.org][Dukhaa]]).
If we listen to those moments we can use them to guide our practice.
For example - we can see what happens if we amplify them, if we *go with* something
that was serendipitous.
