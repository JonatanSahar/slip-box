#+title: Reward can offset the (metabolic) cost of better performance
[[id:20220221T160259.019621][Reward improves motor performance]], possibly by [[id:20220221T170219.514092][Reward improves online correction in motor learning]]. [[cite:&manoharMotivationDynamicallyIncreases2019]] suggest that while making better, i.e. faster and more accurate, movements through improved online feedback is more metabolically demanding - the knowledge of reward makes it worthwhile for the brain to invest this extra cost.
