#+title: colloquium lecture notes: koby rosenblu, on learning and the insula
- long term memory storage
    - we actually know very a little about how memories are stored

- it's misleading to think about the "function of of the brain" since it's so interdependent with the body and the environment

- memory formation
    - our state
        - emotional
        - physical
    - the attributes of the stimuli
        - valence
        - novelty
        - etc

- the triangle of body, brain and evironment

- metabolic stress and learning
    - kinases activating eif2alpha
        - when P'ed it reduces transcription and translation of proteins which are important for synptic plasticity (=learning)
    - ageing is actually prolonged metabolic stress

- neurogenesis in the hippocampus
    - enriched env.
    - exercise
    - antidepressants
    - they found that the known factors all work through less phosphorilation of an elongation factor - so more elongation of synaptic plasticity proteins
        - excitatory neurons
        - inhibitory (GABA) neurons
        - astrocytes

- impact of mind on brain
    - tsai et. al papers from MIT
        - synching the brain into gamma frequency through light flickering

- the insula
    - interoception
    - multimodal sensory processing
    - taste
    - correlation with other areas
        - with mPFC
            - novel taste learning
            - also retrieving of learned knowledge
        - with amygdala
            - taste valance learning
        - different neurons are responsible to learning and to retrieval

- insula an mind-body
    - the immune sytem
        - how the brain influences it?
            - does it encode immune memory?
                - activating insular cells a month after inflamation creates the same inflamation again without the pathogen
            - CID conditioned immune response
                - coupling a new stimulus (taste) with a substance that creates or represses an immune response
                - after a month - the same taste creates the same response
                - the response is the same kind of response - if the agent was a specific pathogen the conditioned response would be the fitting response
                - makes sense evolutionarily
                    - a "fore" for the immune system on encountering the signs (e.g. taste) of a known pathogen
