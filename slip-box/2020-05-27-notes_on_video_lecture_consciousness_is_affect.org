  - cortex is *un* conscious. many cortical functions shown to work without
    awareness/consciousness.
  - when
  - these are the 7 basic emotional drives (opposed to Freud's only 2)
  - sensory/bodily vs emotional affects
  - emotional needs are *hard* to answer - > need to learn from experience
  - prediction vs reality -> drives behavior
  - ego (cortex) "borrows" consciousness from id
  - id *not equivalent* to unconscious, two separate things.
  - unconscious resides in the part of the brain that has to do with
    "non-declarative" long term memory. 
  - short term memory = consciousness, long term memory = descriptive unconscious
  - unconscious in nonscientific terms is located in the systems that deal
    non-declarative LTM. esp. emotional (Amigdala) and procedural (Striatum)
  - cognitive unconscious - responsible for automated, learned, responses. 
  - not only good responses are automated, also our  "least bad" childhood solutions
    for unsolvable problems - i.e. repression of needs/wants that it was illegitimate
    dto fulfill
  - repression is "automatized predictions about how to meet our needs in the world
    that were illegitimately automatized" (even though they didn solve the problems
    at hand)
  - "the id (i.e. needs) is conscious, the ego aspires (i.e. learns to resolve needs)
    to zombiedom"
