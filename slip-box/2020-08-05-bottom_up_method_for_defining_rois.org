#+TITLE: bottom up method for defining ROIs
in cite:heuvel18_hubs_human_fetal_brain_networ they describe a method for defining [[file:2020-08-03-roi.org][ROI]]s that's similar to how k-means works:
 1. start with all voxles as separate "clusters"
  2. merge adjacent clusters according to similarity in their measurements at a
     given time - maximizing in-cluster and minimizing out-of-cluster similarity
  3. repeat until some threshold
