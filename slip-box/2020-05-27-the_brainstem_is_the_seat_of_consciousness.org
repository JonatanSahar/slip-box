The [[file:2020-05-27-ras.org][Reticular Activting System]] in the [[file:2020-05-27-brainstem.org][Brainstem]] is the seat of the most primal and [[file:2020-05-27-consciousness_is_affect.org][basic type consciousness]] - affect.

* evidence/indications of the brainstem being the source of affects:

  - patients with frontal lobe damage exhibit *more* emotions, not less. (indicates
    that the [[file:2020-05-27-cortex.org][Cortex]] is not where consciousness is)
  - when patients experience affects, the brainstem lights up in fMRI
  - deep brain stimulation creates deep/strong emotional states in patients

* evidence/indications that the brainstem is the seat of consciousness:

  - even tiny lesions there create a state of coma
  - even without cortex there is still evidence of consciousness in the sense of
    appropriate, timely response to stimuli. e.g. in children with hydraencephaly
  - brainstem receives information from all senses (except smell )
  - psychiatric drugs work on areas in the brainstem as well
