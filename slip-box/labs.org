     - asks big questions behind the details of actual reaserch 
     - neural codes that underlie cognitive phenomena: 
       * reinforcement learning
       * generalization of learning
       * emotional modulation of memories
       * extinction and maintenance of memories
       * primitives of computation
       * social cognition and learning
       * 

**** Rafi Malaach

     - [[https://www.weizmann.ac.il/neurobiology/labs/malach/][lab site]]
     - perception and free will. looks interesting, good lecture in ELSC.
     - how preconceptions affect vision and creaton of coherent/meaningful 
       percept.
     - the brain at rest  
     - from the site:
      We study how our perception and spontaneous behavior are reflected in 
      neuronal activity
      Our overall aim is to understand how visual images and free behaviors 
      emerge from such patterns of activity.

     - [[https://www.weizmann.ac.il/neurobiology/labs/ahissar/][lab site]]
    - perception, specifically touch and vision, in humans and rats.
    - also deal with brain-machine interfaces 
    - from their description:
    - from the site:
      What does it mean for a brain to perceive? 
      What are the processes underlying the seemingly effortless acts of seeing, feeling, hearing, tasting or smelling? 
      In our lab we try to answer some of these questions. We focus on the senses of touch and vision: 
      we study them in rodents and humans, construct them in synthetic (robotic) and hybrid (brain-machine) agents, 
      and substitute one with the other

     - the prefrontal cortex. 
       - high-order processes
       - working memory
       - emotion regulation
       - behavioral control
       - social behaivor and long-term memory

**** Yadin Dudai

     - [[https://www.weizmann.ac.il/neurobiology/labs/dudai/][lab site]]
     - learning and memory in rats and humans
     - esp. the conversion of one-shot experiences into long term memory
     - in rats: combination of molecular, cellular and behavioural methods
     - in humans: sophisticated behavioural and FMRI

**** Rony Paz

     - stress and related psychiatric/psycologic disorders
     - epigenetic mechanisms
     - metabolism
     - frmo genes --> behavior  
     - stress in early life

**** Yaniv Ziv

     - [[https://www.weizmann.ac.il/neurobiology/labs/ziv/][lab site]]
     - memory, long term memory
     - how is it stored? how does it change?
     - in vivo optical imagery (yikes)

*** Sensation and perception
**** Merav Ahissar

     - [[https://elsc.huji.ac.il/faculty-staff/merav-ahissar][lab site]]
     - A cognitive neuroscience lab which studies perceptual learning
		   task and stimulus driven
		   in various populations â€“ typically developing
		   individuals with dyslexia and individuals with autism.
       We use computational, behavioral, ERP and imaging tools to
       understand the cognitive nature of processes and their relation to brain
       structures and mechanisms.
     - also under cognition

**** Ami Citri

     - [[https://elsc.huji.ac.il/faculty-staff/ami-citri][lab site]]
     - Experience dependants plasticity
     - how the brain chooses what sensory information to accept and keep, the 
       role of the claustrum
     - how these experiences are kept and built on (made into habits etc.) 

**** Leon Deouell

     - [[https://elsc.huji.ac.il/faculty-staff/leon-deouell][lab site]]
     - when does non-concious information processing become concious perception 
       and can affect behavior and decision making
     - working with patients post-stroke with unilateral damage, those that
      have no concious perception and response to events in one side.
     - also under cognition

**** Eran Lotem

     - [[https://elsc.huji.ac.il/faculty-staff/eran-lottem][lab site]]
     - The neural mechanisms of decision making
     - Looking for specifc brain areas that patterns that are responsible for
       choosing one thing over another.
     - foraging
     - serotonin not only inhibitory
     - mechanisms of inference in humans and mice

*** Cognition
**** Ehud Zohary

     - [[https://elsc.huji.ac.il/faculty-staff/ehud-zohary][lab site]]
     - How we create the image of the world around us - visually
     - How preconceptions and expectations combine with sensory input in
       creating our model of the world

*** Aviva Berkowitz Ohana
** Gonda center - Bar Ilan
*** Roy Salomon

    [[https://www.salomonlab.org/][lab site]]
    investigates the sense of self, the way the self relates to the body 
    ([[file:2020-05-15-body_ownership.org][Body ownership]], [[file:2020-05-14-embodied_self.org][Embodied Self]])
    for example - a research showing that the Insula (a brain region) is
    implicated in suppressing visual effects that are related to the heartbeat.
