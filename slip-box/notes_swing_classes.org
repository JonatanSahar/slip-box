* Sep (SSDF '21)
*** riffing off
*** movement idea vs "a move"z
*** I'm a dancing body
*** put the groove into a move
*** groove is something you feel in your body
*** dare to be ugly
*** this is my jazz/this is me - be proud of it
*** reconnect with: my body, the music, the heritage (moves), other dancers
*** sharp & raw
*** round lindy hop is whitewashed
*** don't look in the mirror
*** get the groove with feet planted
*** dance while touching your body with your mind - concentrate on a different body part each time
*** large round movements in warmup
*** Jazz is about being all you can be, about being as much yourself as you can, about sharing that
*** leaders only give a direction - followers say yes in any way they want
*** stronger frame
*** follows connect on the back like the leads
*** feet rhythms "like tap" - keep a low stance
*** radical honesty, being direct, fearless
