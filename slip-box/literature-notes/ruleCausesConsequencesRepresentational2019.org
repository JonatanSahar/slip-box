#+title: Notes on Rule, O'Leary, Harvey, Causes and Consequences of Representational Drift
* general notes
A review paper about representational drift: the population of neurons that codes for a specific task and their relative level of activation (firing rate) changes significantly over time - even for a task that we are experts in.

Work on mice with calcium imaging:

They say that redundancy and reccurance can start to explain:
the brain saves high dimentional representations of tasks/memories which can be represented in a much lower dimension - so there are a lot of different codings in that high-D space which code for the information that we want to save, giving flexibility and robustness.
