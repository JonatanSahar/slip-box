#+title: Notes on James, The Importance of Handwriting Experience on the Development of the Literate Brain
* general notes
Review of fMRI studies

they scanned 4 year olds before and after 4 week training with letters in one of two ways:
-  writing letters by hand.
- watching and naming them (see-and-say)

They found that only in the writing group did brain activation while seeing letters activated the same region as it did in adults.

The deduce that "printing letters by hand actually formed neural specialization for letters and perhaps paved the way to creating the brain systems that were used for subsequent reading".

Copying was better than tracing  [cite:@liHandwritingGeneratesVariable2016]
 but only when tracing a single font(!). When traacing handwriting or multiple fonts there was no difference:

Variability is important for learning:
learning through seeing variable shapes created better learning than learning the same shapes

Self generation of shapes creates variability - which we then immediately perceive.

*However* learning the letters by seeing , even if they were variable in form, did not result in recruiting the reading network unless the letters were self-produced
