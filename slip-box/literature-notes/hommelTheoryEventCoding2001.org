- Basically, the theory holds that cognitive representations of events (i.e., of any tobe- perceived or to-be-generated incident in the distal environment) subserve not only representational functions (e.g., for perception, imagery, memory, reasoning) but action-related functions as well (e.g., for action planning and initiation). According to TEC, the core structure of the functional architecture supporting perception and action planning is formed by a common representational domain for perceived events (perception) and intended or to-begenerated events (action).
- address the mutual interactions between representations of perceived and produced events  and the structure of the functional architecture that takes care of generating, transforming, and storing these events.
