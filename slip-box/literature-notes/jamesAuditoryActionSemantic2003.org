#+title: Notes on James, Gauthier, Auditory and Action Semantic Features Activate Sensory-Specific Perceptual Brain Regions
* general notes
A paper about grounding of semantic knowledge in perception

They trained subjects to learn about novel objects through association with a single defining feature which was in a specific modality, e.g - it's related to sound (buzzez), or motion (it hops) etc.
They found activations in relevant modality brain regions when subjects saw the images of the objects they learned
