#+TITLE: Moving consciousness science forward
There a problem with the state of the field - that the leading theories are all developing in parallel, each gaining support from confirmatory papers, with very few papers trying to contradict the theories predicitions - of which there aren't enough to begin with.
In addition to confirmation bias, there's a bias relating to the methods used, with Itai & Liad's paper showing that certain methods bring about evidence supporting specific theories.

What can we do to move beyond this?

*** pre-registration of what we predict we'll find
*** thin about what would convince us that we are wrong?
*** look more critically at data
*** make more theory-neutral studies
