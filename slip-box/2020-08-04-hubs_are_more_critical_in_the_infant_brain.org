#+TITLE: hubs are more critical in the infant brain
according to cite:heuvel18_hubs_human_fetal_brain_networ, hubs in early
development are more vulnerable than random nodes
in the [[file:2020-08-03-roi.org][ROI]] graph (12% vs 14% decrease in network efficiency, statistically
significant), and they seem to suggest that in adult brains hubs are not as
critically important - maybe because there's more redundancy in paths between
areas.
