#+title: Class notes: brain networks and graphs

* types of connectomes
*** structural
***** cable connecting
*** functional
***** co-activation
***** resting state connectivity
******* spontaneous activity
******* very slow ~0.1 Hz, once in 10 seconds or so
******* divides the brain into several basic networks
********* like the DMN
*** effective
***** like functional, but directiona
***** causal
***** who sends to whom
***** can't really do this from fMRI, don't have the temporal resolution
* challanges
*** we have methods of getting the edges, but defining the nodes is still hard
*** how to validate?
***** we can't really validate through the "truth"
***** but we can get more converging evidence and become more confident
*** what are we asking?
***** there's lots and lots of data, but not clear what to ask about it
***** need more hypotheses
* graphs
*** properties
***** G(vnE)
***** a walk of length K
******* means K *edges*
***** a path
******* a *path* is a walk with all different nodes and edges
***** a cycle
******* a path that starts and ends in the same node
***** tree
******* connected acyclic graph
***** connected graph
******* can get from any node to any other
***** dis-connected graph
******* components
********* any dis-connected graph can be split up into different connected components
***** simple graph
******* no more than one edge between two nodes
******* no self loops
******* we strive for simple graphs because the math is simpler
***** directed graphs (digraphs)
******* more interesting
******* not really available through fMRI
******* strongly connected graph
********* there's a directed path from any node to any other
***** weighted graphs
******* edge weight = how strong the connection is
******* different definitions of strength
********* number of fibers
********* strength of correlation of activation
********* rate of information transfer
*** how to define a graph for the real world?
***** the way we define the nodes influences what we can infer from the network
***** what is the definition of edge weight?
*** representations
***** edge list
******* adjacency list
***** incidence matrix
***** adjacency matrix
******* most comfortable
******* good for visualizing too
********* can see if the network makes basic sense - like RH LH separation
*** creating a graph
***** thresholding
******* removing connections that are weaker than some value
******* to remove noise
********* the problem starts when the noise is strong enough to compete with actual connections
******* threshold will be different depending on the graph
********* we need to tailor the threshold based our knowledge of neuroamatomy
***** binarization
******* deciding that connections either exist or don't regardless of strength (once over the threshold)
***** measuring method really impacts the network we get
******* see node strength example
*** analyzing a graph
***** network density
******* actual connections/total possible connections
******* will be lower the higher the threshold is
******* global measure
***** node degree
******* how may edges from it
******* local measure
******* node strength
********* sum of weights of connected edges
***** degree distribution
******* the distribution of degree values across the network
******* a frequency distributiuon
******* can ask about the cummulative distribution
******* or how many nodes have a degree > K
******* random graph (wedos-renyi)
********* create a graph from a predefined probability distribution
********* currently broadman distribution fits the actual data best
********* TODO: complete
***** centrality
******* used for defining hubs
******* degree centrality
********* just the degree
******* eigenvector centrality
********* look at the connections of my neighbors
******* closeness
********* relative to the sum of shortest paths between the node and all other nodes
******* betweenness
********* TODO: complete
***** hubs
******* are very reproducible
******* very conserved in evolution
******* a window in the "plan" of the organization of the brain
* hubs
*** all methods are pretty similar in the end results they give
* shortest paths
*** from v to all other nodes
*** djikstra's algorithm
*** efficiency
***** global
******* the reciprocal of the mean shortest path p
***** node
******* same but for paths from that node to all others
* small world (range)
*** a connectivity that creates an efficient network but is not a fully connected or random graph
*** balance between cost (=number of edges) and efficiency
* motifs
*** clustering coeeficient
***** the number of pairs of neighbors of node v that are connected to each other
*** a relatively new idea in application to the brain
* we always compare the measures we talk about in the brain to a random graph (erdos) - that the baseline
* modules
*** a group of hubs which are highly connected among themselves
* segregation and integration
*** not very empirical, more descriptive
***** still in its infancy
*** generally - a measure of how local vs connected processing is
*** the brain is very integrated very early in development
***** major hubs are already in fetal brain
*** problems in integration are seen in mental disorders
***** may be a biomarker in the future
*** most mathematical modelling comes from working on fiber tracking - anatomical connection
***** it's simplest
******* least amount of different interpretations
******* they get the adj. matrix directly
*** in neuroscience - most work on networks is done on resting state, in fMRI
