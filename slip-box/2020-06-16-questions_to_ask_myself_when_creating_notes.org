* To check why I'm creating a note:

  - When would I need this?
  - Why did I save this?

* To expand:

  - Which question does this answer?
  - What argument does this add on?
  - So what?
  - What's next?
  - How do we solve the problem?
  - What do we do with it?

* To check assumptions:

  - What lead you to this idea?
  - What makes you think that?
  - What are your assumptions here?
