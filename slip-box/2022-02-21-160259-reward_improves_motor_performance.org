#+title: Reward improves motor performance
 [[cite:&galeaDissociableEffectsPunishment2015]] and [[cite:&manoharMotivationDynamicallyIncreases2019]] show that when subjects were learning a motor task - reaching for something with a manipulendum - on trials where the movement had a know reward attached to it they had better [[id:20220221T161153.447426][accuracy]] and [[id:20220221T161140.809836][speed]]  and in fact broke [[id:20220221T161022.283341][speed-accuracy tradeoff]].

 However - this heightened ability  was transient, applying to reward trials only, unless(!) They learned an improved movement which was more energetically efficient ([[id:20220221T165325.768595][improved motor performance due to reward is only persistant if it also means we're not working as hard]])
