#+TITLE: Notes on colloquium lectures

* Ido Davidesco - synchrony
*** synchrony - attention, physical, brain
*** portable EEG in biology class
*** student to group synchrony
*** engagement and synchrony to group are highly correlated
*** brain to group synchrony seems to predict self-reported engagement
*** very coarse measures, an average of all EEG channels - no info on localization
*** couldn't it be just a shared response to a shred external stimulus?
***** it is associated with measures of engagement
***** seen also when there is much less obvious stimuli like working in silence.
*** when students are not engaged, there's a boost in alpha activity.
***** it's idiosyncratic
*** engagement -> suppressed alpha
***** power goes down (in alpha), and synchrony goes up
*** how close do you feel to each of the other students?
***** eye contact baseline
***** closeness correlated with synchrony
******* to other students and to the teacher
*** effects on learning:
***** self report and intra brain synchrony were not predictive of learning
***** brain to brain (group) synchrony was pretty well correlated with learning
***** student - teacher synchrony also predictred learning - and the time lag between the responses mattered.
***** measured the synchrony during the relevant time in the lecture (per question in the test)
******* good correlation between group correlation during the specific time and the matching questions
* Avi Mendelsohn - learning
*** the greater the prediction error, the stronger the learning effect
*** for subjects that were wrong in the 1st test, if they were very certain that they were correct - they retained the correct answer better for the 2nd test
*** strong correlation between surprise and activation in the frontal & dorsal striatum
*** for declarative learning (=information) too!

***

*** information that guides decision making
***** implicit vs explicit
***** personal experience vs observation
***** do rewarding environment enable better declarative memory
***** slightly better performance in trials where we are rewarded (monetary)
***** better performance in situations where we have an active choice in events
*** the best way to register information into memory is to be actively wrong, confident about it, and to have fun while doing so :)
*** as scientists we  need to be uncertain, not to be over confident, the more we learn the more we know we don't know. it's ok for me to show that I'm uncertain too.
