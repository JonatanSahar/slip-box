   - entropy: high disorder, also high level of uncertainty (subject puzzlement)  
   - pre-critical state suggests stronger suppression of entroy in humans, but
   also higher level of entropy to begin with.
   - suppressed entropy -> our waking normal cognitive functions and states:
     ego, reality checking, self awareness.
   - "primary states" ->
     * high entropy in certain areas
     * collapse of coupling between DMN and medial temporal lobes.
     * collapse of organization withing DMN

   - crtiticality:
     1. maximum meta-stability (many networks)
     2. maximum perturabililty (sensitivity to changes)
     3. maximum
   - testable via drawing parallels to "other primary states" such as REM and
     early psycoses, and in contrast to non REM sleep, waking consciousness and
     anesthesia.
