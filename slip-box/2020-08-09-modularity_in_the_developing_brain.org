#+TITLE: modularity in the developing brain
an exaple of segregation (see [[file:2020-08-09-segregation_vs_integration.org][segregation vs integration]]), modularity
signifies the existence of dense clusters that are sparsely interconnected.

Each such module, a community of nodes, is in theory, a specialized unit - that is best suited to some
kind of information processing.
