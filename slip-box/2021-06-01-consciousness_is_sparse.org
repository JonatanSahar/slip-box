#+TITLE: Consciousness is sparse
Some claim that the contents of consciousness are actually not as rich as we usually think they are. That in fact, we only experience a small fraction of the details that reach our senses (perception?), and we fabricate most of our experience in a significant way to make it seem consistent and whole.

There are two main models of this sparsity:

*** overflow
***** our capacity for richness and detail in _phenomenal_ consciousness is limitless
***** what's limited is our WM and other capacities which (later?) make sense of the experience and enable us to report on it.
*** illusion
***** two approaches: fragment illusion, and gist
******* generally mean that consciousness is limited in real time ... TODO complete
