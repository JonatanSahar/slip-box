when it's too complicated for automated responses (see [[file:2020-06-08-affect_is_designed_to_make_us_answer_our_needs.org][Affect is designed to
make us answer our needs]]), how our affects "feel" tells us if we're on the right
track to fulfilling the need that that particular affect is derived from.
This enables us to work our way in unfamiliar situations, and also to navigate
complex situations (where several needs conflict) and to learn from experience
(see ).
