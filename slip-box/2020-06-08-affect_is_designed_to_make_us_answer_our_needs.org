#+TITLE: Affect is designed to make us answer our needs

  the [[file:2020-05-27-brainstem.org][Brainstem]] has nuclei that monitor the body and they represent the state
  of the organism through deviations from homeostatic settling points.
  These deviations are felt as affects (see [[file:2020-05-27-consciousness_is_affect.org][Consciousness is affect]]) and there
  are as many basic affects (=homeostats) as there are basic needs including
  "emotional affects" for emotional needs - 7 in all according to [[file:20200507190753-mark_solms.org][Mark Solms]].

  up to a point our automated (=inherited, innate, embedded in the genome) are
  enough to keep our vitals within the range of values where they should be,
  using our own internal resourcesm but once we're too far from the settling
  point we need to go into the world to satisfy our needs.
  
  At that point the brainstem arouses the cortex to take action in the world.
