#+title: Modulation of self-generated stimuli - examples

Using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), it has been shown that even during motor preparation (that is, before the actual motor act) sensitivity to sensory stimuli is already reduced16.

been shown that during voluntary movement, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is enhanced (even in the lack of sensory feedback) and functional connectivity with pre-motor cortex is increased

increases in speech production rate result in increased cerebral blood flow in auditory cortices even when auditory feedback was blocked by white noise that was kept constant across rates20.

fMRI signal in the auditory cortex during active speaking (relative to passive listening) has been shown to be attenuated in STG but enhanced in superior temporal sulcus of the same subjects23.
