#+TITLE: Amatuers have more fun

  The stress of a success/failure mindset is all around us, all the time, in anything we take upon ourselves to do.
  It can be a much nicer experience to let go of needing to accomplish something - it makes us free to play with what we're doing, to investigate playfully, to be creative without fear of the consequences, to enter a state of flow - concentrating fully on the moment and the richness of experience.

  If we're not concerned with any external measures of success, we have less that distracts us from enjoying the thing we're doing (music, painting, ceramics)

  Can work also be this way? Reading articles, writing code? Learning?
