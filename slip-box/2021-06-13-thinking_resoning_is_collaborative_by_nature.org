#+TITLE: Thinking (resoning) is collaborative by nature
- source :: aeon

Reasoning about something, clarifying to ourselves what we think about it, and developing the capacity to think critically and find arguments for and against an idea - all of this actually requires putting the idea into words, looking at it from some distance, and changing through synthesis, by meeting opposition from other people's views.

It's actually not something that you can do well by your own -  like rock climbing - it's meant to work in cooperation - more like tennis
