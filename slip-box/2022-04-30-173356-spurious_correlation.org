#+title: Spurious correlation

When two variables or time series have a high correlation between them, but that correlation is in fact explained by some third variable or factor: either the third variable is the cause of both variables, or there is a common trend in the data for both which is due to some intrinsic property of both of them.
Example:
- weight from birth till age of 20 of different people
- number heads - number of tails in coin tosses (there is some high probability that a correlation will arise between two different coins because of properties of the probability distribution)

* What can we do about it?
- We need to make sure to account for the interdependence of the signals, to remove trends an periods
- make sure the series is "integrated" (not sure what that means)
