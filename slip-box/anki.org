    What is the problem with using white noise as a baseline for comparison of brain activity?

**** Back

    we are activating a whole bunch of cognitive processes that are not necessarily what we want to measure (greater attention, surprise, etc.)  - since white noise elicits so little response

   How does the magnetic gradient allow you to choose the slice in an MRI scan?
**** Back
    The gradient changes the magnetic field in a predictable way, and in different magnetic field the larmor frequency of the hydrogen atoms is different = they absorb and return different RF frequencies. We can then choose which RF freq to focus on.

    How does the strength of the gradient affect the thickness of the slice in an MRI?
**** Back
    The stronger the gradient, the steeper the slope of the frequency/distance graph, so that more frequencies map onto a smaller distance range. So: stronger gradient => thinner slices for the same band-width

    Why does the RF freq have to be synchronized with the magnetic gradient in an MRI scan?
**** Back
    RF freq is synchronized with the gradient because the targeting of a slice is a combination of the G and the RF pulse freq - the RF has to match the larmor freq at the wanted slice, which is determined by the G

    How doe a Fourier transform of an image work?
**** Back
    - fourier transform of an image: we give a differnt frequency to each pixel, and set the amplitude of that frequency to e.g the grayscale value of the pixel. We then sum all the sinusoids of the different pixels into a single waveform.
    - this is a compressed view of the image in the time domain, and FT can get us back into the picture domain.

The indirect path is meant for reduction of unwanted movement
    - the subthalamic nucleous is a GPi activator (so when it's active it's a thalamus inhibitor)
    - the GPe is an inhibitor of the hypothalamic nucleous
    - there's a neuron in the striatum which is an inhibitor of the GPe
    - the cortex activates that neuron in the STR -->it inhibits the GPe --> GPe stops inhibiting the subthalamic nucleous --> the subthalamic nucleous stops inhibiting the GPi --> the GPi continues its action as a thalamus inhibitor
    - and so there's less activation of M1 in the cortex

    What is the difference between MSME and turbo spin echo?
**** Back
    In turbo spin echo we change the gradient before every 180 pulse, so we change the row from which we sample the echo: we get multiple samples from different rows in the same K space

    In MSME we just repeat the 180 pulse and get gradually more T2 weighted images from the same row - in different K spaces.

**** Back
                                    We don't have to use a 90 deg pulse, if we use smaller angles we'll have to wait less time between pulses, so we have a shorter Tr (and faster scans)

    How (what pulse program) do we compute T2*?
**** Back
                      If we give more and more alternating gradients, we get another measurement from each of them - each with a progressively longer Te.
                  the strength of the signal from each is decaying, exponentially, with time constant T2*!

    How does the DIXON method work?
**** Back
    It's meant for suppressing one kind of tissue - either water or fat.
     when they are in phase (at the beginning) and when they are exactly opposite ("out of phase"). in the in phase image the signal is s= water_s + fat_s, and in the out of phase image the signal water_s - fat_s. By combining them we can get just the fat or just the water signal, e.g use hte fat signal as a mask.

    What is the black line aretfact we get in DIXON images? Where do we usually see it?
**** Back
    It happens when there are - in the same voxel - similar proportions of water and fat. When that happens, the out of phase images show a significant decrease in signal, because they cancel each other out.

    We would usually see it in the border of organs

    How do we measure diffusion with an MRI?
**** Back
    In Diffusion weighted imaging we use a pair of pulses with a delay between them, and measure the transverse magnetization. Where the diffusion is greater the dephasing is greater and signal is weaker.

    We do this measurement in many directions, and get the diffusion values in all of them.

**** Back
                        what happens (probably) it that in an ischemic state (=when there's reduced blood flow after stroke) the *cells swell*, and also become more tortiouse - *more convoluted* and harder for water to move inside. So the *diffusion becomes slower* and as a result *the signal becomes stronger:*

    - Lab  once in 2 weeks
    - Must read lab prep handbook before  there will be a quiz every lab  20% of the grade

    - groups of 7, should register with someone

    - The CNS is one continuous tube. we should always ask ourselves what’s the inside (=space), and what is the “side”/דופן.
    - The brain is the “side” and the CSF is the “inside”
    - Foramen magnum = the big hole, is the whole in the cranium through which the CNS continues into the brain.
    - In humans, the foramen magnum is directly below the skull, in dogs, e.g., it is more caudal, more towards the tail. The place changes along the evolution.
    - Endocranium = what’s inside the cranium/skull = brain  also grows with evolution.
    - Also with evolution: gyration, the brain becomes more convoluted, to allow more of it in the same space. To allow for birthgiving.
    - Also: the chewing area becomes smaller and smaller
    *  The spinal chord
    - goes through the vertebral foramen
    - the pedicles have concave bottom and to, so when they're one on top of the other, they create the intervertebral foramen - where the nerves leave the the spinal chord:

        + 7 cervical vertebrae: C1 - C7
        + 12 thoracic vertebrae: T1 - T12
        + 5 lumbar vertebrae: L1 - L5
        + sacrum - 5 fused
        + coccyx - 4 fused
        + total 33 vertebra
        + they are numbered from rostral part to caudal (head to to tail)
    - the sacrum vertebrae still have intervertebral foramen - the coccyx does not.
    *** segments  of the spinal chord:
        + we can divide the spinal chord into 31 segments, each having a spinal nerve going out of it (and into it)
        + each spinal nerve has both directions!
        + why not the same number?
            + first nerve goes out just before C1, and is called C1
            + goes on till C7 - named for the vertebra that's below it

            + also only 1 nerve for "all" the coccyx vertebrae
        + the spinal chord terminates a lot earlier than the spinal column - *around L1-L2*
        + point of termination is called  *conus medullaris*
        + in the bottom of the spinal column there are many roots making their way to their exit points.
        + this area is called cauda equina = horse tail
        + Filum terminale (= terminal film) is the rest of the pia mater continuing after the spinal chord is terminated
        + in the ara of the filum terminale down to S1-S2 there the *dural sac* full of CSF, but no spinal chord.
        + after the dural sac is the coccygeal ligament - the end of the dura and archanoid layers
        + epidural injections and LP for sampling the CSF will be done usually around L3-L4 since there's no risk of hitting the spinal chord
        + Limb enlargements:
          Areas where the spinal chord is thicker - thicker nerves, more information
          Used for areas where we have finer motor control, and higher resolution sensing.
            + cervical (neck)

                + enervates legs and feet
    ***** Gray matter of the spinal chord:
        + in the spinal chord the grey matter is on the inside, and the white matter is on the outside. In the brain, it's the opposite.
        + in the grey matter there are "dorsal horns" reaching almost to the vertebra
        + also there is a median fissure - a long deep groove on the ventral side.
        + there's a hole in the middle of the grey matter - it's the central canal, and it's full of CSF.

            - Laminae of rexed - layers in the gray matter, different cells and functions in each layer.

        + mater is mother in latin - comes from translating the original latin to arabic, where it's really called mother, and back to latin after the middle ages
        + pia mater is so thin we don't see it. It sticks to the surface of the brain, and goes into all the fissures.
        + in the brain, there's no space between the dura and the skull (in health)
        + in the spinal chord - there is space there. That space is called epidural space (epi = above)
        + between the dura and arachnoid there is the subdural space (sub = under)
        + between the arachnoid and the dura there is always space too - the subarachnoid space.
        + the subarachnoid space is filled with CSF
        + also in the subarachnoid space - the blood vessels of the brain

    - denticulate ligaments - the pia leaves the grey matter and gets lodged into the dura. Maybe meant to give structural stability to the spinal chord.
    *** white matter of the spinal chord:
        + the white matter is devided into three *funiculi* - frontal, lateral,ventral
            + funiculus means "cable" they look like cables from the side
            + each funiculus is divided into fasciculi
            + e.g. the dorsal(sensory) funiculus is devided into:
                + fasciculus gracillis - enervates legs
                + fasciculus cuneatus - enervates hands
            + fasciculus comes from fascia/fasces - the roman bunch of twigs
        + schematically we may say that:
            + lateral areas enervate the arms
            + medial areas enervate legs
            + and in between areas enervate the trunk
            + dorsal areas are sensory
            + ventral areas are motor
        + The higher we are in the spinal chord there's more white matter, because all the information tracks/ nerves that go in/out of the brain come together
        + in the lower segments there aren't really any lateral horns
        + reflex arc:
            + when there's enough activation in the sensing area, the information travels to the dorsal root ganglion and the sensory nerve cell bodies there.
            + if there's enough activation, the sensory neuron will activate the adjoining motor neuron in the ventral horn (through an interneuron) - directly, without waiting for information from the brain.
            + we can choose to premeditatively inhibit the reflex, through inhibition of the interneuron
            + this inhibition is dependent on the magnitude of the stimulus
    * Embryology
    *** 1st week - blastocyst

    - On the day of conception, there is a zygote
    - This cell begins to split exponentially
    - On days 4-5 the Morula
    - On Day 5-6 the blastocyst forms
        + This contains the embryoblast (the fetus forms from this) inside and the trophoblast which creates the membrane (go on to form structures external to the fetus)
    - The blastocyst cavity is the space within the blastocyst

    *** 2nd week - bilaminar disk
    [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211227_120927_kcozm2.png]]
    During week 2 the embryoblast divides into the Bilaminar Ebryionic Disk which costsists of epiblast and hypoblast cells

    *** 3rd week gastrulation

    :END:
    - moving from 2 layer disk to 3 layer disk
    - primitive streak, develops along the midline, caudal to rostral.
    - primitive node leading the change
    - invagination of the epiblast
    - the epiblast cells *replace* all of the hypoblast cells (they were only usued for support during the first weeks)
    - 3 layers:
        1. ectoderm - outer
           Skin, hair, and *nervous system*
        2. mesoderm - inner
           Muscles and skeleton
        3. endoderm - inner
           Internal organs
    - invaginating cells are pluripotent - they can develop into any and all types of cells.

    *** neurulation
              - 4th week (6th week of pregnancy)
              - the ectoderm separates into ectoderm and neuro-ectoderm
              - neuro-ectoderm develops into the neural plate
    ***** the notochord
                  + develops from the primitive node (caudal) to the rostral area
                  + the spinal column and spinal chord will develop from it
                  + a part of the endoderm - will become a part of the mesoderm
                  + signals a lot of developmental factors by secretion
                  + induces development of neural part of ectoderm - called *neural plates*
                  + in the middle of the spinal chord there's a small hall/tunnel - that's the remainder of the notochord
    ***** the neural tube
                  + neural plates invaginate and close to create the *neural tube*
                [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211227_124357_arcBvD.png]]
                  - closes from the cervical area (middle of the spine) towards both ends
                  - leaves two neuropores - anterior and posterior, they close after 25 days or so
                  - can have pathologies when not closing properly:
                      - anencephaly - anterior
                      - spina bifida - 3 kinds:

              - the rest of the non-neural ectoderm covers the neural tube from above
              - betewen the ectoderm and the neural tube there's the neural crest - which used to be the outer border of the neural plate:
                [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211227_191435_zox8yp.png]]
              - neural tube --> the CNS
              - the neural crest --> the PNS
              - somites - muscles and bones
    ***** development of the spinal chord
          - from the neural tube
          - dorsal part - alar plate (from wings) - will develop into sensory neurons
          - ventral part - basal plate - will develop into motor neurons
          - between them: the sulcus limitans
          - roof plate - dorsal
          - floor plate - ventral
          - ependimal cells - line the neural plate from within
          - so the neural tube becomes an actual hollow tube
          - as time goes by - there are more cells, and the hollow part becomes smaller
    ***** development of the brain
          The rostral part of the neural tube doesn't stay as a regular tube:
          - it segments into three parts (vesicles):
              1. prosencephalon (pros = frontal)
              2. mesencephalon (mes = missle)
              3. rhombencephalon (rhomb = rhomboid = מעוין)
          - 5 vesicles stage:
            The front brain splits in to, the hindbrain splits in two, and the midbrain continues on as midbrain (mesencephalon)
              1. *telencephalon* - mostly cortex
              2. *diencephalon* - mostly the thalamus
              3. mesencephalon - the midbrain
              4. metencephalon - cerebllum and pons
              5. myelencephalon - medula oblongata
              - the eyes (the retina) are part of the CNS! They develop from the diencephalon
          - the neural tube starts to fold - creating the structure of the brain
            [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211227_192542_iySHRz.png]]
          - *gyrification* - the telencephalon starts to invaginate, "in order" to get more tissue into the same volume of skull
          - the temporal and frontal poles grow further and further apart, the temporal pole goes backwards, and then laterally - *creating the C shape of many of the structures of the brain*
          - falx medialis - a dura that grows between the two hemispheres - that's why they grow to be flat on the medial aspect. Flax - מגל
          - pathologies: when the two vesicles don't separate
              - holoencephalon - no telencephalon, but we do get the outside of the cortex, just empty
              - cyclopia
    * Topography of the brain
    *** cerebrum - the big brain
                - longitudinal fissure - between the hemispheres
                - five lobes:
                  - frontal
                  - parietal - from the greek for wall (paries)
                  - occipital - from "back of head"
                  - temporal - from tempo, time, where age is first notices in the graying hair (of george clunney)
    *** brainstem
                - midbrain
                - pons
                - medulla oblongata
    *** cerebllum - the small brain
    *** four main features of the lobes - good for orientation:
                - central sulcus (rolandic fissure)
                - temporal sulcus (sylvian fissure)
                - paraieto-occipital sulcus - not seen well from the temporal view
                - preoccipital notch
    - corpus callosum - white matter conencting the hemispheres, lit. Large body (of white matter)
    - fornyx - ventral to the corpus callosum
    - lateral ventricles - dorsal and lateral to the fornyx
    - third ventricle - below the fornix
    *** mid-sagital plane
    ***** thalamus
    - evolves from the diencephalon (the cortex develops from the telencephalon)
    - anything with -thalamus in the name also develops from the diencephalon
    - relay station from all senses excep olefactory
    - inter-thalamic adhesion connecting R and L thalami
    - septum pellucidum - divides the two lateral ventricles.  stretched between corpus callosum and the fornyx
    ***** hypothalamus
    - below and to the front of the thalamus
    - mammillary body is a part of the hypothalamus
    ***** the pituitary gland, outside of the brain, but continuous with the hipothalamus.
    - anterior part develops from the non-nueonal ectoderm
    - posterir part (=neuorhypophysis) is part of the thalamus itself, develops from the neural tube
    - from the posterior pituitary hormones - oxytocin and vasopressin
    - from the anterior part - other hormones
    ***** pineal gland
      - secretes melatonin, syncs our biological clock.
    *** ventral view
    ***** olfactory system:
    - bulb
    - tract
    - lateral stria
    - medial stria (unused in humans?)
    - uncus (main processing area for smell in the cortex)
    ***** Optic:
    - nerve
    - chiasma
    - tract
    ***** Pituitary Gland
    - vetral to the chiasma
    ***** orbital gyri (above the eye socket)
    ***** rectus (straight) gyri
    * white matter and connections
    *** Development
              - at the beginning the vesicles are empty - the neural tube is just the wall of the tube
              - telencephalon grows much more than the rest, and the convolustions start taking up the internal space
              - the *lamina terminalis* is the anterior-most part of the telencephalon when it develops (as it grows, other parts become more rostral/anterior than the lamina terminalis)
                [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211227_223330_9QrJz8.png]]
              - the space is filled with CSF (CSF is very similar to the blood plasma)
              - the wall becomes thicker and thicker (becomes neurons = gray matter, cell bodies)
                [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211227_223439_LrFYgn.png]]
              - the space becomes filled with two types of tissue:
                  + neurons:
                      Neurons send axons - white matter, and they do it in bunches - nerve fibers/tracts
                  + subcortical nuclei (= non cortical gray matter)
    *** White matter:
          - centrum semiovale- like it sounds - general name for the white matter
    ***** projection fibers - connect the cortex with non-cortex structures
                      - corticopetal - into the cortex
                      - corticofugal - out of the cortex
    ******* corona radiata - the "fan" of white matter
    [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211227_224708_AwVpr3.png]]
                        - seen on the sagital plain/lateral section, but not medial, slightly off-center
                        - the lower, ventral, part is called the internal capsule  the fibers come together and become more dense.
    ********* the internal capsule
                          - "hidden" by the lentiform nucleous (when looking from the side)
                          - on the horizontal section (from above) - has five parts:
                              1. anterior limb
                              2. genu
                              3. posterior limb
                              4. retrolenticular part - fibers going caudally towards the occipital lobe - also called the *optic radiation*
                              5. sublenticular part - the *auditory radiation* - going into the auditory cortex
                          - medial to the internal capsule is the *thalamus*
                          - summary of connections from the internal capsule:

                      - usually between lobes
                      - like a road, not all axons have to go all the way through, they can leave the fasciculus anywhere
                      - supirior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF)
                        C shaped, from frontal to temporal lobes

    *** corpus striatum (striped body)
    ***** develops from the telencephalon - from an area of growth it the rear of the telencephalon - along with the rest of the  *basal nuclei*
    ***** white matter fibers growing down from the developing cortex *divide* the growing striatum (almost) into two parts
    ***** from the lateral mass of the striatum will develop the *lentiform nucleous* (from lentil - עדשה) and from the medial mass - the *caudate nucleous*
    ***** the lentiform sits "inside" the internal capsule
    ***** the caudate grows "above" (dorsally to) the thalamus before it wraps around the internal capsule of the corona radiata
    ***** the medial mass elongates dorsally, and wraps around the white matter - the corona radiata, back in a lateral direction - this the "tail" (caudate)

                            + secrete dopamin
                            + dopamin can be either inhibitory or excitatory depending on the post-synaptic neuron:
                                - D1 receptors create excitation
                                - D2 create inhibition
    ***** Thalamus and the motor system
    ******* divisions: (then more subdivisions)
                        [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211229_120553_dSKG8Q.png]]
    ********* anterior nuclei
    ********* medial nuclei
    ********* lateral nuclei
                - activates the cortex
                - *SNr and GPi are thalamus inhibitors*
                - the pyramidal system - two neurons from cortex to muscle - this is not enough for fine grained control
    ******* extra-pyramidal system
                      - works with agonist-antagonist pairs of muscles
                      - this is the role of the basal nuclei
                      - the VA (ventral-medial) and VL (ventral lateral) thalamic nuclei are involved in planning and initialtion of movement
    ********* The extrapyramidal system has two pathways:
                            [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211229_124237_phIYw7.png]]
                                     - both pathways operate all the time creating a balance of inhibition and activation of the thalamus = of movement initiation commands, and of the magnitude/strength of activation. This way we can create very gentle and precise movements
    *********** direct - *for voluntary action*
                                    - the striatum (caudate and putamen) inhibits the GPi and the SNr
                                    - the GPi  and the SNr  inhibit the thalamus
                                    - the thalamus activates the cortex
                                    - the direct path is when the cortex activates the striatum, causing the it to inhibit GPi/SNr -> they stop inhibiting the thalamus -> the thalamus is free to activate the cortex - to tell it to initiate a movement.
    *********** indirect - *reduces/inhibits unwanted movement*
                                        - the cortex activates the striatum (STR) - specifically an inhibtory neuron connected to the GPe
                                        - GPe usually inhibits the subthalamic nucleous
                                        - subthalamic nucleous activates GPi/SNr (which are thalamic inhibitors)
                                        - CTX activates STR --> STR inhibits GPe --> causes activation of subthalamic nucleous --> activates GPi/SNr --> inhibit thalamus --> no movement commands
    ********* role of SNc in thalamus activation:
                            - in the direct pathway, the SNc neurons are connected to the putamen through D1 (=excitatory neurons), so they *support* the direct (=activating) pathway = *supporting movment*
                            - in the indirect pathway SNc neurons connect to the putamen through D2 neurons (=inhibitory) neurons. Since putamen activation eventually inhibits movement, this means the *the SNc inhibits the indirect pathway*, and _supports movement_.
                            - so *SNc always supports movemnt!*
                            - that's the main problem in parkinson's disease - the initiation of movement
                            - hemiballismus - a malfunction in the mechanism of inhibition (caused by damage to the subthalamic nucleous) in some motor pathways, that causes ballistic (large and fast) movements in some body parts
                            - chorea - another symptom of damage to the basla nuclei - causes many large movements in the whole body (looks like dancing)
                            - *exam questions: what would happen if we damage any of the components of either pathway?*
    *** the ventricles:
                  - two lateral ventricles - separated by the septum pellucidum
                  - third in the middle
                  - septum pellucidum develops from two septums, that usually merge before birth
    ***** third ventricle - rubber chicken head.
    ******* has an eye and recesses created by pineal gland and more
    ***** choroid plexus
                        made of blood vessels and pia - filters out the red and white blood cells and elts only the plasma through to make the CSF
    * Histology
            - how the tissue looks
    *** histology of the cortex:
    *****  Neocortex
                    - new, in evolutionary terms
                    - the great majority of the human cortex
    ******* 6 layers of cells, based on the way the tissue looks
                      1. Molecular - almost no cell bodies, mostly connections

                      2. External Granular - connect other cortical areas in the same hemisphere
                      3. External Pyramidal - mostly connect to the other hemisphere

                      4. Internal granular - gets all the input from the thalamus
                      5. Internal Pyramidal - mostly sends towards the brainstem. Here there are the primary motor neurons (Beltz cells)

                      6. Multiform - mostly towards the thalamus
    ******* divided into columns - each col. contains all the layers, columns are usually responsible for some function
    ******* there is no clear physical boundary - but sometimes moving a 0.5 cm to the one side moves a different finger for example.
    ******* Bordmann areas - in different areas of the cortex, the distribution of the layers is different. the columns have substantially different function subserved by different layer structure.
    ********* examples:
    *********** primary sensory areas get a lot of sensory input from tehe thalamus, so it has a thicvker layer IV
    *********** association cortex אסוציאטיבי: multimodal representation of concepts - inputs from many types of areas - has a rather balanced struvture
    *********** primary motor cortex: has almost no sensory input, so no layer IV, but huge pyramidal neurons, so very thick layer V.

    ***** Allocortex - not new
    ******* Paleocortex - old, very old
    ********* 4-5 layers
    *********  Olfactory System (olfactory bulb; olfactory tubercle; piriform cortex)
    ********* Parahippocampal gyrus
    ******* Archicortex - archi=first, so oldest in evolutionary terms
    ********* 3 layers
    ********* Hippocampus
    * functional localization
    *** general division
              - Primary Cortex
                  * the area where the representation is the closest to what exists at the periphery
                  * for the motor pathway - the last stop before the brainstem/spinal chord
                  * for sensory input - the first stop on the way in
              - Secondary Cortex
                  * a higher representation than primary cortex
              - Associative Areas
                  * combining information from different modalities
                  * concepts
                  * sensory-motor feedback/correction?
    *** the motor cortex
            - primary motor cortex - M1
                - BA (brodmann area) 4
                - no internal granular layer, i.e. No layer IV ("agranular cortex")
            - secondary/associative motor cortex
                - Premotor (=before, more frontal than motor) Cortex  - BA 6
                    + generation/execution of a motor plan (high level like walking)
                    + activates and coordinates neurons in M1
                - SMA supplamentary motor area - in the most medial part of the premotor cortex, also folds into the medial surface - also BA 6
                    + planning movement - activates the motor plan in the premotor cortex
                    + anticipation of external conditions relating to the movement - like the trajectory of a ball we want to hit
                - Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
                    + error detection (not only motor!)
                - frontal eye field (FEF)
                    + synchronizes the movement of the eyeballs so it's consistent with the rest of our movement and where we put our attention - lower part of BA 8
    ***  the somatosensory cortext
                - primary sensory cortex - S1
                    + BA 1, 2, 3
                    + postcentral gyrus
                - secondary sensory cortex
                    + BA 5, 7, 40
                - damage to associative sensory areas:
                    - tactile agnosia (types:)
                        - astereognosis - inability to recognize objects by touch. (Though no problem using them)
    *** the visual cortex:
              - BA 17
              - around and inside the calcarine sulcus
              - aka the striate cortex
              - stria of gennari
    ***** laterality
            - the right optic nerve has information from the left visual field and vice versa
            - from the eye to the LGN
            - from there, through the internal capsule and the optic radiation, to V1
            - each LGN has information from *both* eyes, the left (right) side of each of them:
              [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211219_164435_RLHHXU.png]]
            - the LGN has 6 layers.
    *****  V1 organization
                  - is retinotopic, but inverse:
                      + what's high on the visual field arrives at the bottom of V1:
                        [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211219_164745_Oe44iC.png]]
                      + meyer's loop: fibers of the upper visual field go through the temporal lobe - "backwards" (more ventral) from the thalamus, and only then to V1 (see above)
                      + what's outside, is represented deepest and most "inside" in the cortex
                  - simple cells: neurons that respond to lines in one particular orientation, in one particular location across the visual field.
                  - complex cells: respond to the orientation regardless of location
    ***** secondary/associative areas:
                  - in secondary areas we have neurons that respond to collections of lines in various orientations: shapes
                  - gradually, hierarchially, becomes more complex
                  - mostly in BA 18 & 19, to the sides of BA 17
                  - [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211219_170204_KAyMG5.png]]
                  - two streams:
                      + ventral  "what"- inferior temporal lobe
                      + dorsal "where" - parietal lobe - close to the somatosensory cortex
    ***** damages:
    ******* prosopagnosia - face blindness - the man who thought his wife was a hat
    ******* right hemisphere is more active for face recognition
    *** the gustatory cortex
            - taste: BA 43
            - bottom of the central sulcus
    *** the olfactory cortex
            - smell: BA 34 (uncus
            - perhaps the most ancient sense
            - no relay station like the thalamus, directly from the nose to the uncus - through *the olfactory trigon*
            - Closely linked to the limbic system
             - Extends to the Limen of the Insula and Amygdala
    *** the auditory cortex

    What is the difference between a hematoma and a subarachnoid hemmorage?
**** Back
    In a hematoma the brain suffers physical pressures from the buildup of blood between it and the skull - it can squash the brain and/or cuase it to herniate into the infratentural compartment.

    In a subarachnoid hemmorage there is much less buildup of pressure but blood can go everywhere and the brain becomes suffused with it - which is toxic
