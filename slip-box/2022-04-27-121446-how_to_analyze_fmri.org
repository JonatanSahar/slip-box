#+title: How to analyze fMRI


* connect to the MRI center file
***** Other locations in file manager
***** smb://mrilabfs.tau.ac.il/mri_XX_lab$
***** username/password - same as in TAU


* Order the data on my computer:
*** BIDS  folder structure
The standard way to order and share imaging data
https://bids.neuroimaging.io/

Batel has a script for that :)

* types of sacns
***** Mprage - anatomical
***** cmrr - functional
***** each scan name contains the number of volumes, and a name we can choose
***** there's an _sbref scan for each scan: used for motion correction, we don't use it usually
***** each dicom is 3D at a given Tr
***** use the 2nd mprage dir - has been filtered
* analyzing with FSL
Can open individual tools from command line - for GUI, call tool with capital letter (otherwise is calls the function directly)
*** BET
    Extract the brain only
    need to do only once - for the anatomical data, FEAT later uses it
    give it the anatomical DICOM

*** FEAT - first level
***** Data:
            Preprocessing & GLM analysis
            first level: single run
            second level: multiple runs
            group analysis
            fulle analyis = inc. running a GLM
            highpass filter = 100HZ

***** pre-stats
            Keep defaults, and add slice time correction = interleaved

***** registration
            Select anatomical_brain image (from BET)
            for the standard space use full search & 12 DOF

***** Stats
            Need to create an EVs (events) files for every kind of event that happend in the scan:
            [[/mnt/g/My Drive/notes/slip-box/2022-04-27-121446-how_to_analyze_fmri.org_20220427_130611_bCeBCg.png]]
            onset  duration weight

            The GLM: "Full model  setup"
            create a page for each EV
            HRF: double gamma

***** post-stats = multi comparisons correction
            Don't need for first-

***** save!  before hitting go
            Creates a "batch" file : .fsf

***** go
            Creates a FEAT report html that updates in real time
            shows the quailty of registration, motion correction, the details of the statistical model etc.

            Can run from command line as "feat path/to/design.fsf"

***** load
            load an existing .fsf file
            can create an empty .fsf with names of vars in "", and then populate file with a script


***** output:
            Work with filtered_Func_data feed into FSLeye

            cope files: the different contrasts we computed: we can use them later for the higher order analysis.

            in stat directory:
            - peNUM: the beta value for each eventNUM in EVs: also NIFTI files, the beta for each voxel
            - tfiles - the t-values for each voxel

            Feat doen't apply the transformation to MNI - the coomputations for doing so are in reg dir.
            Also in reg - hires_head - the anatomical head

*** FEAT - higher level
    Analyze multiple runs from the same esubject
    input the cope files from previous analysis of all runs
    averages the different run + transforms to MNI space

*** FSLeyes
    Presentation of images

*** dcm2nii - external app
    Convert DICOM to NIFTI
