#+title: Correlation (time-series)

What are the appropriate tools to measure the relationship/synchrony between twho time series?

* Cross correlation

* Making the time series "stationary"
In some sense to remove an underlying trend and/or periodicity
Beware - any two time series that share a common general trend may be show [[id:20220430T173356.888380][Spurious correlation]]
*** Maybe want to apply differencing?
