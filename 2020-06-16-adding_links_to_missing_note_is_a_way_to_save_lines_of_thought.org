#+TITLE: Adding links to missing note is a way to save lines of thought
When adding links to a note, creating empty notes to link to, *and tagging them
as something that needs completion* can be a way to find where to start thinking
from when I get stuck, and also to mark avenues I wanted to think through but
didn't have the time at the time.
