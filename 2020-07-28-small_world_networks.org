#+TITLE: small world networks
Network topologies where most nodes are not neighbors, but the average (shortest) path between any two nodes is small, while at the same time the [[file:2020-07-28-clustering_coefficient.org][clustering coefficient]] is relatively high

(in contrast with random graphs where the average distance is small and the clustering coefficient is also small)


to measure small-worldness, you take the ratio between *normalized*  avg. shortest
path, and *normalized*  clustring coefficient of a graph, where *normalized* =
divided by the same property in a random graph.

for a network to be said to display this feature, the ratio should me much
greater than 1
