#+title: Thesis experiment planning

* Auditory-motor:
- blocks of RHRE RHLE LHRE LHLE
- they'll play twice in a row at their own pace
- a short fixation break between blocks
- 3 runs, 20 blocks each =  5 of each ear/hand combo, 10 ipsi 10 contra per run.
- two localizers: motor only and auditory only. One run each. (*question:* is it enough trials?)
- repeat the motor localizer at the end -
- total ~5.5 minutes per run

*** Analysis
    - compare the activation in the auditory cortex between ipsi and contra hand playing - using a GLM. Do this separately for each ear.

    - compare all 4 conditions (RELH, RERH, LHRE, LHLE) with [[id:20210627T195237.647411][ANOVA]], look for a mixed effect of hand and ear (=effect of laterality).

    - decode hand from auditory cortex. Do this twice: once for the stimulated ear (cortex), once for the unstimulated ear.

    - compare functional connectivity between ipsi and contra hands per ear.
        + *question*: of course there will be a correlation in activity between motor and auditory cortex, because the both operate at the timing of key presses - how to deal with this?

    - compare the activation in the auditory cortex during the motor-only task:
        + compare between ipsi and contra hands per ear
        + compare between pre- and post- experiment scans.


*** Code design:
     - define an 8 second scan time in advance.
     - randomize 4 conditions: RHRE RHLE LHRE LHL
     - motor only run: localizer + baseline for checking modulation
     - auditory only run: localizer + baseline for checking modulation
     - auditory-motor familiarization half-run
     - auditory-motor part
     - motor only run: for checking modulation

     - for all parts:
     - for each block in blocks
         + get type of block (hand/ear)
         + display instruction: which hand to play with + which ear will be heard + "get ready!"
         + wait for Tr: display instruction to play
         + process midi information and play it back to subject
             * save the start time and end time of playing
         + save information about block in table (type, start/end time, ...)
         + display instructions for next part + "get ready!" for 8 sec of rest
