* 17/10/21 - MRI - creating the signal
*** intro
- noninvasive
- sequence of events :
  - enter the subject into the machine
  - magnetization buildup
  - radio signals hitting the subject
***** spacial coding
  - collecting the radio sequence
- the strongest that the magnetic field of the earth gets (in the poles) is ~0.5 gauss (1 tesla = 10,000 gauss)
- in TAU there's an MRI with a magnet of 3 tesla
- RF signal, spacial encoding & signal collection (digitation): called a pulse program
- by changing the pulse program we can get different contrasts (which show different things)
- a spinning charged particle creates a magnetic field
- electrons have a magnetic field
- electrons like to be in pairs if at all possible, so when there's an odd number of electrons, they're all paired up, and their magnetic fields cancell each other out
- an atom with an odd number of electrons will be magnetic
- in the MRI we measure the magnetic properties of the *nucleus*
- the magnetic properties of electrons are about 1E3 that of the nucleus.
- why don't we use the electrons then? Because ni order to disturb/excite the nucleus we can use RF - for electrons we need microwaves (which would be harmful)
- when we put tissue into the MRI, all molecules align their magnetic field with the magnetic field of the MRI - either with it or opposite it.
- for every 1,000,000 (1E6) there's one extra molecule that goes with the MRI compared to going against it.
- in a gram of tissue it ends up being 1E17 molecules extra, so we end up with some net magnetic field created in the tissue
- molecules with spin that goes with the MRI are at a lower energy level, while those with spin against the MRI meed to invest energy in maintaining their magnetic field
- the stronger the magnetic field in the MRI, the bigger the difference between the energy levels.
- high energy spins: beta, low energy: alpha
- radio waves change the spin of low energy molecules, and when they stop the spin goes back (because of equilibrium), and radio waves are shot back out

* 24/10/21 & 31/10/21 - MRI - reading the signal

        - the gradual decaying of magnetism - from XY plane back to Z following the RF pulse happens for the *
        - once the RF pulse hits, the direction of all spins becomes synchronized, and from that point they go around the positive Z axis in larmor frequency together.
        - variation in larmor freqs:
          in fact there can be any number of groups of spins spinning in different larmor frequencies, since  different materials have different $\gamma$ values ($\Rightarrow$ different larmor freqs)
*** fourier transform
        - takes us from time to frequency domain.
        - In the frequency domain information is more compact
    - the FT shows us the many frequencies of the different material/tissues in the sample - which aren't visible when looking at magnetism vs time plots

*** FID - free induction decay *** T1 - longitudinal relaxation אורכית
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       20220117T111153.399761
:END:
        - the spontaneous relaxation from $\beta$ to $\alpha$ after RF excitation.
        - back to Z axis
        - takes time: fast in the beginning, then slows down
        - rising magnetism value
        - rises as more spins go back to $\alpha$
        - molecules with high energy (=$\beta$ spin in its H nuclei) need to find othe molecules they can "give" their energy to - and it needs to be a molecule that can absorb specifically the amount of energy that they have to give (same larmor freq?)
        - if the molecule moves too fast or too slow, it will take longer for it to find a matching molecule to give the energy to
        - *we can discriminate between different materials by the length of their T1*
            + the shorter the T1 of a tissue, the quicker it returns *the full* amount of RF energy it received.
            + during the scan we repeatedly send RF pulses and measure the returns. If we wait long enough, all tissue types will return all of their energy, but if we send another pulse before a given tissue returned all of the energy (i.e before the excited protons all returned to alpha level ), we would read less energy returned from it.
            + shorter T1 will show up as brighter on the image
        - measuring T1 - Inversion Recovery
            + it's a pulse program (called inversion recovery)
                * give 180 degree pulse (now have more beta than alpha, in the same proportion as before the pulse)
                * wait for inversion time (*TI*): some spins have gone back to alpha
                * give 90 degree pulse, to test the current magnetization level
                * repeat over and over with different TIs
                * use the information to construct the magnetization graph - from that we can extract T1 from the formula of the graph
                * especially good for anatomical structures
                  
*** T2 - transverse relaxation
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       20220117T115347.092496
:END:
    - time of disappearance of signal from XY plane
    - always much shorter than T1
    - measures dephasing - the signal becomes weaker since it depends on all spins being in phase with one another, and after the pulse they immediately begin to go out of phase.
        + there's no actual loss of energy yet - no spins went back to alpha
    - why do spins go out of phase?
        1. molecules have slightly different larmor frequencies
        2. spin-spin interactions: when nuclei come closer together, they feel each other's magnetic fields, and it creates a local magnetic environment - theses interactions change their larmor frequencies
    - the magnetic field is not homogeneous for other reasons as well (metal in our teeth, humidity in skull cavities etc.)
    - *only dephasing due to local magnetic environment (spin-spin interactions) are considered T2*
    - the longer we wait, the smaller the net (vector sum) of magnetization will be, so tissue with shorter T2 will show less magnetization after a given time than tissue with longer T2
*** T2*
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       20220117T120714.095834
:END:
    - T2* - dephasing caused both by non-homogeneity of the magnetic field (due to iron etc. In the tissue) and spin-spin interactions (so it encompasses T2)
    - What influences T2*?
        + Interference with the magnetic field
        + The transition between tissues (sinuses)
        + Various metals (rubber band, tooth crown, makeup ....)
        + Iron ions in tissue
        + *Deoxyamoglobin*
        + anything that influences T2
    - When is T2* used?
        + When you want to measure heterogeneity in the magnetic field
        + The source of the heterogeneity is iron which influences the T2* of water.
    - What influences T2?
        + Spin-Spin interaction
            * Slow-motion - Large fluctuations in the magnetic field - Short T2
            * Fast Motion - Averaging of fluctuations The magnetic field - Long T2
    - T2 is a very sensitive measure
    - Used primarily when there is a suspicion for a rise in the quantity of water in the tissue

*** the magnetic field gradient
- added by us
- changes with distance
- makes the noise
- makes the larmor frequency change with distance
- every slice along the body has its nuclei spinning in a different - predictable! - larmor frequency.
- can choose which frequency = which area to target with RF pulse
- can choose the axis along which we slice - axial, coronal, saggital, and any combination
- can choose the thickness of the slice
- the strength of the gradient changes the the relationship between radio freq (=larmo) and location of slice.
- stronger gradient - thinner slices (for same frequency band width)
- RF freq is synchronized with the gradient - the targeting of a slice is a combination of the G and the RF pulse freq

*** K Space
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       20220420T171516.202923
:END:
- fourier transform of an image: we give a differnt frequency to each pixel, and set the amplitude of that frequency to e.g the grayscale value of the pixel. We then sum all the sinusoids of the different pixels into a single waveform.
- this is a compressed view of the image in the time domain, and FT can get us back into the picture domain.
- for our use - we start in the time domain, we have the RF output response, and we want to create an image for us to look at.
- we know where each larmor frequency "belongs" (to which pixel in the final image) by using two more gradients within the slice, to change the magnetic field in the X and Y axes too.
    - called frequency gradient and phase gradient:
        + phase - changes along a row
        + frequency - changes along a column
- can't sample frequencies at the same time - must look at X and Y separately
    - so - we go over the X and Y gradients one line at a time
    - TR - time between scanning each line
    - so total time of experiment is TR * N_phases (= # of lines)
    - TE - time to echo - how long we wait for the echo to converge so we can measure T2
- during the TR of one slice (while we wait for the line to complete), we can start the next slice, and the next one - so we don't lose time
*** contrasts
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       20220420T171643.773969
:END:
- signal dependency in TE:
  the more dephasing we let happen, the stronger the contrast will be (between fatty and watery areas for example)
- signal dependency in TR:
  If we shorten the TR = don't wait for full recovery (back to Z axis), we will get a different signal from areas that have different T1, so this is another contrast we can get.
- materials which are fatty have a short spin-spin relaxation because the atoms are in a rigid formation, and forced to be close together - so the spin - spin forces are stronger (the repel each other), and must go out phase more quickly. (Both T1 and T2)
  - in water, because the atoms are free to move around, they don't have to operate on one another's spin, and the relaxation is slower. (Both T1 and T2)
- Tr - repetition time - time between 90 deg  RF pulses.
- Ti - time between inversion pulses
- Te - echo time - time between the last RF pulse and measuring the transverse (X-Y) magnetization
- if we want to weigh the image in favor of seeing differences in T2 between tissues:
  - We basically want to just wait let the relaxations happen in their own time. We measure after a while, and see the difference in how quickly the transverse relaxation happened: for tissue where it happens quickly, we'll read little magnetization, and for tissues where it happens slowly - we'll read a lot of magnetization.
  - We want a long Tr (the whole measurement happens after just on pulse), and a long Te
- if we want to weigh the image in favor of seeing differences in T1 between tissues:
         - We want to hit the tissue with two pulses and see the effect of the different longitudinal relaxation on the reading after the second pulse:
         - the longitudinal magnetization would be stronger for tissue with a slower  longitudinal relaxation, because of the same reason: if all the spins go back to the Z axis, after the 2nd pulse the net magnetization in the Z direction would be zero, while for the longer-T1 tissue it will be negtive, but non zero.
         - the transverse magnetization will be weaker in tissue where the longitudinal relaxation is slower, because the 2nd pulse will push more protons in the opposite direction (more than 50%), so some of the magnetization vector would be pointing down, and not in the XY plane. For tissue where the Z axis magnetization recovers completely we'll get the full transverse magnetization signal.
         - We want a short Tr (the  measurement happens after the 2nd pulse), and a short Te so we see the transverse magnetization immediately after the pulse.
*** brain mapping:
    - how to standardize?
    - talreich atlas
      - volume based meausring
      - coordinate system
        - the main axis is the AC-PC line (anterior commissure - posterior commissure)
        - on the mid-saggital plane
      - based on broadman (histology)
    - how to match different brains? Voxel based morphometry
      - registration - realign the brains in space so the mach in orientation
      - normalization - non-linear transformation/deformation of the brains to match their volume, and make their overall skull dimensions the same, so that they are wasier to compare.
      - Segmentation
        * get just the signal that's probably gray/white, CSF - this just an estimation, and says what's the probability that each pixel belongs to each type of tissue
        * based on T1 weightet contrast - that's where the differences between gray matter, white matter and CSF are most clear.
        * Based on the brightness levels and location, we get three (new) images of the brain - gray matter, white matter and CSF - where brightness = probability of that pixel belonging to that type of tissue.
      - Smoothing
        * average the local environment of each pixel in each of the segmentation maps:  get a "cortical density map".
        * why cortical density? Each pixel says how many other pixels around it had the same value, so if a pixel in the gray matter map has high probability value, it means that all the 9 pixels around also had high probability values of being gray matter - so this area of the cortex is dense with white matter.
        * why is this good for us? It makes comparisons *more* reliable (rather than less), since it helps ignore chance differences that may stem from individual differences and the fact that the brains are still not exactly matched even after registration & normalization .
      - voxel based morphometry:
        * voxel by voxel analysis. go over each voxel, and compare the cortical density in that pixel between subjects, or look at correlation between the value and some other measure (e.g age) across subjects
        * VBM limitations:
          1. Changes (smears and distorts) the image
          2. Only really applicable for brains without "space changing" processes like scars and tumors
          3. Uses the cortex for normalization, so we lose the accuracy of comparisons the deeper we go into subcortical areas.
          4. It's so complicated that it's a black box, so we have little ability to criticize it ourselves
    - modern atlases
      - based on many brains, averaged
      - automated brain mapping

:END:
      - Not all materials have a spin
      - in our body, only hydrogen has spin in its natural state
      - sometimes we inject contrast materials - which have spin too.
      - every material that has a spin, has a magnetic moment
      - the giromagnetic constant ($\gamma$): the ratio between the magnetic moment and the angular momentum -  $\mu = \phi \cdot \gamma$
        - different for every matrial
      - hydrogen is simpler magnetically, since it has just on proton
      - hydrogen also has only two energy levels ($\alpha$ and $\beta$)
      - percession = the spinning of the "spin" around the direction of the external magnetic field of the MRI.
      - larmor frequency($\omega$), in an external magnetic field ($B_0$): $\omega = \gamma \cdot \B_0$
        - so it's the same for a given material in a given magnetic field, and will change depending on the field
        - the larmor frequency = RF pulse energy required for $^1H$ in our proportions: $\gamma(^1H) = 42.5 MHz/Tesla$, and our magnets have $B_0 = 3 Tesla$, so we have $\omega(^1H) = 128MHz$ - which is unharmful for humans.
        - $B_0$ is not entirely homogeneous - so we have a range of larmor frequencies in our samples
        - also spin-spin interactions influence the changes in $B_0$
      - we're actually looking at the net difference between spins going with B_0 and spins going against it.
      - the pulse angle = the angle of the net magnetization vector after the pulse - the X (and Y) axis factor will always be the same (it comes from all the spins being in resonance), and the Z axis factor will depend on how many spins went from $\alpha$ to $\beta$
      - Free Induction Decay - the loss of signal from X axis after a pulse:   $m_0 \cdot sin(\omega t)\cdot\e^{( -t / {T2*)}$
      - $m_0$ is the density of protons in the sample. That determines the initial amplitude/signal strength on the X axis after the initial 90 deg pulse
      - T2 - time constant describing the rate of going out of phase

* 14/11/21 - practice class
*** T1 time constant
          - measured in sec/ms
          - ~100s or 1000s of ms
          - determined by the rate of *energy transfer* from the protons to the environment
          - the closer the larmor frequency of the \beta spins is to the "self" frequency of the environment, the quicker the energy transfer will be
***** T1 meaurment

:ID:       20220117T122633.873932
:END:
          - Inversion recovery - adding a 180 deg pulse at the beginning, waiting TI, and giving a 90 deg pules
          - for every tissue type there's a specific TI that we can wait, at which time the Z axis signal is exactly zero (exactly half the spins came back from -Z).
             When we give th 2nd pulse (90 deg) at that time, we get zero magentization measured in our scan from areas with that tissue.
          - this is really useful! We can use the choice of  TI this way to eliminate the signal from a specific tissue type.
            e.g if we want to get rid of CSF signal, in order to make the WM/GM distinction more accurate.
          - VFA: variable flip angle.
              + another method for estimating T1:
                   by using small excitation angles (<90), we get different magnetization profiles for tissues with different T1
              + need to apply B1 mapping to correct for the fact that the angle is not really the same across the entire slice.
              + use two scans in angles $\alpha$ and $2\cdot\alpha$
*** T2*
          - dephasing on X axis caused by any and all factors
          - irrefular magnetic field (from the magnet, from metals, from air in sinuses etc)
          - spin-spin interactions
*** T2
          - dephasing caused specifically from spin-spin interactions
          - Spin Echo - the pulse program for measuring T2
              * a 180 deg pulse after the 1st 90 deg one, creates a *re-focusing*, counters dephasing from constant factors
              * the innate differences in the spin frequency (which contribute a certain amount to the dephasing) will have the same, but reversed effect after the 180 pulse, so they will cancel-out, and at time Te we'll get just the dephasing caused only by spin-spin interactions over the Te period.
              * the 180 pulse has to be given so it's exactly symmetrically placed between the 90 pulse and the measurement time Te: $\tau$ = half of TE
              * we can measure again and again to construct a graph and extract T2
              * because of random(=spin spin interactions) dephasing causes, the refocused signal is not as strong as the original one (signal strength = total magnetization  vector שקול כוחות)
***  General notes:
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       20220117T131517.691359
:END:
          - T1 much longer (~2.5 seconds) than T2
          - T1 becomes longer in a stronger $B_0$
          - water (CSF) has longer T1 & T2 than fat and muscles
          - the MRI *doesn't output a computed map*  = an image where the pixel values correspond to actual T1 times. Instead it gives a contrast map, also known as a *weighted image*, where the colors are relative differences between pixels. We need to compute the T1/T2 values per voxel to get a map with all values on the same scale, given in miliseconds
*** sampling the image
***** gradient and phase:
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       20220117T174158.662352
:END:
              - the gradient we apply to the tissue affects both the RF frequency of the spin of the protons (and hence the freq tissue will respond to), and the phase of the spin: when we change the freq, we change the position of the minima and maxima in time, and after we stop the the gradient it goes back to the original frequency, but shifted in time.
                [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017092007-class_notes_brain_imaging_and_mri.org_20220117_173159_fH5yev.png]]
              - Tr is in a scale of seconds, if we want a 256x256 image, for each slice, and we have many many slices - that would make the scan too long.
              - we can start scanning the next slice while we are waiting for Tr to finish on the line we are scanning in the current slice: Tr is ~5sec, and Te is ~5ms, so we can run echos in ~100 slices while waiting for the first echo's Tr
              - instead we use echo planar imaging (EPI), where we go over the slice back and forth "like a snake"
***** how Tr and Te affect the contrasts that we'll get:
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       20220117T174501.296179
:END:
              - Long Tr - means we're not seeing the effect of the different rates of longitudinal magnetization buildup (Z axis), so *we're not seeing any T1 effects*
              - short Tr - *we do get the differential energy loss effect =T1*
              - short Te - means we're not waiting enough time for the effects of the different dephasing rates of different tissues to show themselves, so *we're not getting any T2 effects*
              - long Te - *we get the dephasing =T2 effects*
              - to sum up:
                - for T1 weighted images: short Tr, short Te
                - for T2 weighted images: long Tr, long Te
                - proton density: long Tr, short Te

:END:
                  - in a weighted image we ge the raw signal value - rather than the T1/T2 times
                                        so for T1 weighted scans, tissues with shorter T1 will have a higher value (they have a steeper slope):

                                    and for T2 weighted images it would be the other way around, shorter T2 tissues will have a lower signal, because they decay faster:

                    [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017092007-class_notes_brain_imaging_and_mri.org_20211216_181427_SLrT9p.png]]


              - in the calculated maps, we get the T2/T1 values themselves, in units of time (sec), so faster T1/T2 would be low values and long ones - high values
***** MSME (multi slice multi echo)
            - A pulse program for which gives one 90 deg pulse then several 180 deg pulses at intervals
            - we get several different contrasts - progressively more T2 weighted
            - we can also use it to calculate T2 values
               [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017092007-class_notes_brain_imaging_and_mri.org_20211216_185819_Edijos.png]]
***** TSE (Turbo Spin Echo)
                - a way to get a fast scan that gives a weighted T2 image
                - we excite once with a 90 deg pulse then repeatedly echo with 180 deg pulses - like MSME.
                  The difference is that we change the gradient we're looking at before each echo, so we're looking at different lines in K space at each echo read.
                - the samples in the center of  have the most information, they affect the created image the most, and so they affect the effective Te of the image (Te_eff) the most
                - we need Te_eff because we sample each line in a different Te (after a different number of 180 pulses)
                - because of this, we can't calculate the actual T2 in the sample, but we do get the qualitative image we may want for diagnosis.

                - the more echos we have, *the quicker we cover the slice* - but *there's a price*: the more echos, the longer we look at each slice, so we can fit less slices in between each Tr - so we get *less brain coverage*

                   * iron
              2. Paramagnetic - low but positive susceptibillity
                   * deoxyhemoglobin
              3. Diamagnetic - almost not susceptible
                   * oxyhemoglobin
          - susceptibillity creates local interferences with the magnetic field B = *affects T2**: creates a decrease in the signal, shown as darker areas.

- this can be "solved" by lower Te, to get the information before it decays, but that would not work for the rest of the brain.
***  SWI
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       20220119T160012.118570
:END:
 - Susceptibility  accelerates the dephasing of the protons
 - different tissue types have different susceptibillity
 - SWI is an enhanced contrast of T2*
 - it's affected by non-homogeneity of the field (which we don't care about) and by tissue attributes (which we do!)
 - composed of *magnitude* and *phase* images
 - when we sample on both X and  Y axes, we get the same information, but with a phase shift
 - we take the x axis info as the real part, and the Y axis data as the imaginary part of a complex number.
 - we usually look at what's called a magnitude image: taking the  $\sqrt{signal^2} = \sqrt{Re^2 + Im^2}$
 - we can also look at the phase the signal is at, relative to a set point, then the phase is equal to: $\Phi = \tan^{-1}[{Im \over Re}]$
*** Phase image:
              - the information in the phase image of an inversion recovery pulse program:
[[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017092007-class_notes_brain_imaging_and_mri.org_20211217_195211_oScwzv.png]]

- SWI is a composite image of magnitude and phase, we get the information from more susceptible tissues like blood vessels along with the structural information we have from the magnitude image.
*** GRE Gradient Echo
              - this is the  pulse program do we use for SWI
                GRE - gradient echo: just a 90 deg pulse, without a 180 pulse to create the echo.
                Instead, we use  the reverse of the gradient we applied to affect and change back the phase of the signal:
                whenever we apply a gradient we create a certain amount of dephasing, since different areas inherently respond to the magnetic field slightly differently, since we know exactly what caused that dephasing we can undo it using the same field with reverse polarity
                [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017092007-class_notes_brain_imaging_and_mri.org_20211219_101815_qba5jy.png]]

                so we get the effects of *T2** when we read the signal (not just T2) - *T2** *weighted image*
                [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017092007-class_notes_brain_imaging_and_mri.org_20211219_104245_RHi8tc.png]]
*** multi gradiend echo (pulse program)
  If we give more and more alternating gradients, we get another measurement from each of them - each with a progressively longer Te.
  the strength of the signal from each is decaying, exponentially, with time constant T2*! - *so this is the way to calculate T2** *of a sample.*
*** using small angles:
  We don't have to use a 90 deg pulse, if we use smaller angles we'll have to wait less time between pulses, so we have a shorter Tr (and faster scans)
*** DIXON method
        - separating water from fat with multi echo GRE
        - we usually want to suppress fat signal (but not always)
        - we know that fat has much shorter T1 than water
        - water has faster larmor freq than fat
        - because of the different larmor freq we know that water and fat will "dephase" at a certain rate
        - we want two points - when they are in phase (at the beginning) and when they are exactly opposite ("out of phase")
        - then we can add or subtract the signals at those points to get either just fat or just water:
          [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017092007-class_notes_brain_imaging_and_mri.org_20211219_110233_wZNdIc.png]]

         "  This artifact occurs in gradient echo (GE) sequences as a result of selecting an echo time (TE) in which the fat and water spins (located in the same voxel at an interface) are out of phase, canceling each other. At 1.5 T, the 3.5 ppm difference in frequency between water and saturated fat results in cancelation of spins at 4.5 ms multiples, starting at about 2.3 ms; for example at 6.8 ms, 11.3 ms, and 15.9 ms. This artifact does not occur with spin echo (SE) sequences as the spins are rephased by the 180o refocusing gradient. "

*** Acquiring the SWI:
                - multiple GRE
                - unwrapping - mathematical procedure to correct for something with the phase going back to 0 = 360 deg
                - filtering
                - phase mask
                - multiply the phase mask with the magnitude image  = SWI:

        - blood flow in the capillary area is very very slow, and the surface area is very large
            + blood flow: in the general sense would be $Flow = {V_{blood}\over time}$, but in capillaries we need to look at the amount of tissue as well: $Flow = {{V_{blood}\over{time}}\over Volume-of-tissue}$
            + blood flow to gray matter much higher (x3) than whit matter
            + blood flow to brain (2% of body weight) is 15% of total blood flow

        - fractional volume
            + we measure in units of voxels, which are much larger than the granularity of the actual tissue we are measuring. When we talk about fractional (partial) volume, we talk about the relative part of a blood vessel compared to the volume of the voxel

            - instead of injecting Gd

            - the signal is proportional to the MTT: the longer it is, the more labeled blood will be preset in a given area
            - there's some difficulty with this method:
                + to get the signal we need to wait for the capillaries across the brain to be filled with the labeled blood - but we are interested in T1, and we can't wait too long, because the signal decays.
                + we get a low SNR, so we have a low spatial resolution

* /12/21 - physiological  basis for fMRI
      - BOLD imaging - Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent imaging
        It's actually just  a normal susceptibillity weighted - T2* weighted - imaging.
      - there's a ~8-10 second delay between stimulus onset and the hemodynamic response we can register in the fMRI, and it took many (~13) years to understand the basic mechanism:
        - there are two types of energy mechanisms in the brain, aerobic (uses oxygen) and unaerobic
        - it's actually (mostly) the astrocytes (glia) that require the greater amount of energy - for pumping neurotransmitters out of the synpatic gap, and for reusing them (like glutamat --> glutamin --> back to the synapse --> glutamat --> vesicles)
          - glutamat specifically is ~50% of brain activity
          - dopamine activity is also imaged well
          - gaba we're not sure, but there's always excitatory activation that goes along with inhibitory activation
        - there are a few competing processes:
          [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017092007-class_notes_brain_imaging_and_mri.org_20211226_094708_dc6mrV.png]]
          - more activity creates more DeHb, since aerobic metabolism consumes oxygen : *decrease in blood oxygenation*
          - on the other hand it creates greater blood flow - which washed away the DeHb and replaces it with OHe: *increase in blood oxygenation*
          - overall increase in oxygenation create an *increase in signal*
          - it also creates more blood volume, both directly and through higher flow: *decrease in field homogeneity --> decrease in signal*
*** explaining the BOLD response:
          [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017092007-class_notes_brain_imaging_and_mri.org_20211226_095628_wQ068W.png]]
          - it takes about 20(!) Seconds for the entire response to build up and subside
          - we usually sample every few seconds and average the samples so we average out the dips and the overshoot - but they happen in the background

* 26/12/21 - DWI - diffusion weighted imaging
      - diffusion is a *micro-level process*, influenced by the microstructure, the cellular level
        So we can get, in a way, higher resolution than the voxels we usually look at
      - measuring diffusion: pulsed gradient spin echo
      - in DWI, the slower water molecules move - the stronger the signal!
        - because when a water molecules moves, they get out of phase faster
      - we apply gradients in three axes - X Y & Z
      - we apply each of them twice, to get the difference:
        [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017092007-class_notes_brain_imaging_and_mri.org_20220102_090558_SSwvyY.png]]
      - we don't have to apply all three - whichever we apply, we measure diffusion in that specific direction
      - three important parameters: gradient strength $G$, gradient duration  $\delta$, and diffusion time (time we let the water to move around between gradients) $\Delta$
      - $b$ is the _diffusion weighting factor_
        [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017092007-class_notes_brain_imaging_and_mri.org_20220102_092205_IlU72f.png]]
      - in real experiments we set only the b factor - not the gradient strength and duration - and we can extract $D$ which is the quantity that we care about
      - D is the _apparent_ diffusion coeficient: water has a single specific diffusion coef. (constant), in the brain, water diffusion is disrupted by the tissue, so what we measure is the diffusion coef inclusive of the disruption

                    what happens (probably) it that in an ischemic state (=when there's reduced blood flow after stroke) the *cells swell*, and also become more tortiouse - *more convoluted* and harder for water to move inside. So the *diffusion becomes slower* and as a result *the signal becomes stronger:*

***** as a measure of activity
                    cells swell (to a lesser degree) also when they are active, so diffusion can tell us about activity:

                    - after inducing localized activation (with KCl in rats) and doing diffusion images every few seconds in different areas - they saw that there's indeed a temporary decrease in diffusion in the area of activation
                    - they also saw that there's a wave of activation from the primary area that spreads out
                    - we can use it for functional imaging (not very good at the moment)
***** diffusion and plasticity
                     After playing the same race course (need for speed) for two hours subjects became very good at racing it.
                     They scanned them before and after and saw that there's a significant change in the ADC (=apparent diffusion coefficient) in the hippocampus - this is _not_ due to swelling, but due to morphological changes in the tissue: there are more synapses, more white matter,  that represent the learning that took place. (Very cool)

          - voxel based comparisons:
                            Like with T1 images - we can normalize, inflate brains, match them to an atlas and *compare different groups of subjects*.
            We can look at organic differences between normal controls and different pathologies - like schizophrenia or reading disability and look for consistent differences in WM connectivity.
          - *we want to be careful with interpretations!*
              - DTI doesn't really measure connectivity - it measures diffusion, and it's not actually the same, though it's tempting to make that connection.
                  E.g - in subjects with faster reaction times to visual stimuli there was a _lower_ FA in the egress from the IGN towards V1. Why? Thin axons have very high FA, they're very directional, but they are poorer conductors than thicker axons.
              - another example: lower FA can also be because of water accumulating around axons
              - there are also effects that are due to the registration process (matching different brains through mathematical transormations): if for some subjects what we think is WM is actually GM, we'll get a change (increased FA) in the signal.
          - mean diffusability
          - tracktography/fiber tracking

  - theres a problem of crossing fibers - there are now algorithms that pretty much solve it: *spherical harmonies*.
*** Limitation of DTI:
***** in areas of heterogeneous WM, where there are a lot of crossings - it's very inaccurate
***** it's an average of everything that goes on inside the voxel, which is much much larger than the fibers we are interested in (and think that we're measuring)

***** default mode network(s)
            in resting state: basal activation of the brain, what looks like noise in task fMRI.
          - very low frequency - as low as 0.1 Hz
          - when we look at R and L motor cortex activity in resting state, we see that they are almost perfectly correlated  - and with almost 0 correlation with other areas like V1.
          - we can do the same with V1 or other areas, and we can thus define several networks - areas that are highly correlated withing themselves and uncorrelated with the rest of the brain.
          - localizationinsm vs globalism:
                      Are there different areas in charge of different functions, or is the brain more of a decentralizes system, working as a whole.

                    - can devide based on histology/cytoarchtecture/broadman
                    - eventually reserachers gave up and now we often use a random division of the brain into many many (1000's) of areas
******* edges:

* 2/1/22 - fMRI
        - looks like its measuring input and local processing rather than spiking activity and output - but not sure
        - the brain works in circuits - dopamine leaves the brainstem and returns there
*** stages of analysis:

              Many many possibilities of parameter choices. Each parameter is a decision, and can change the results.

********* scaling of the input stimulus will increase the response by the same measure
********* additivity - response to two stimuli is the same as the sum of the responses
********* time invariant
********* we know it's not really linear - but it's close enough and we know how deal with linear models much better.
******* GLM - general linear model
********* voxel-by-voxel analysis
********* we have the time series of the voxel, and we try to fit a linear model to explain it - we have the onset of the different conditions (regressors of interest) and other variables (nuissance regressors), and we look for $\betta_i$ that are the weights of the different regressors in constructing the signal:

********* we assume the "actual" response is something like this:
                        [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017092007-class_notes_brain_imaging_and_mri.org_20220106_154818_MW4B3h.png]]
********* with different kinds of noise added to it: low freq (alertness) high freq (breath, heart rate), drift (magnet warm up, head sinking steadily), head motion:
                        [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017092007-class_notes_brain_imaging_and_mri.org_20220106_155034_4y5Aen.png]]
********* so the linear model tries to separate the noise and the signal, building a model that is some linear combination of the expected noise and signal + residual noise that was not predictable from the model.
*** HRF - hemodynamic response function
          - is variable between subjects and even within subject - from trial to trial and between brain regions
*** design
          - usually we try to model movement and to nod throw away data
          - block design better for detection of function in areas
          - parametric modulation: instead of predicting activation/no activation, we predict the magnitude of the response based on the magnitude of the stimulus + some model we have of the brain function
          - if we want to study the effects of a disease - we need to give the patients a task that they can preform. Otherwise we won't have a meaningful effect - we need a range of different performances

* summary: imaging methods/pulse programs:
*** (multiple) IR SE inversion recovery spin echo
         Used for getting a *T1* contrast, while eliminating a certain tissue type.
         The timing of the 90 deg pulse (TI) is matched to the relaxation time of the tissue we want to get rid of: the time when the magentization has gone half way back and so its size is zero.

        This lets us get a better *dynamic contrast*: when we don't have the very high value at one of the extremes, we get better differentiation between the other tissues.

        To get a calculated map with actual T1 values we need to run this multiple times (multiple IR SE), with a different TI every time: the different TI means a different amount of spins has had the chance to get back to normal, and we get a different size magnetization in the X direction, and so a different amount of Z magentization after we wait for it to build back up again. We then extract T1 from the numerical graph of magnetization vs time.

        We need to wait long TRs


          - FLAIR - IRSE with TI to eliminate the *CSF*
          - STIR - IRSE with TI to eliminate *fat*
*** multiple TR:
         Similar idea of extracting *T1*, but now we use *a range of short TRs*, so the magentization doesn't have enough time to build back up between 90 deg pulses, so we again get diferent Z axis magentization

         Rule of thumb: we need TR to be at least $TR \ge 5\cdot T1$

*** problems  with multiple TR and IRSE:
          - take a long time
          - slice crosstalk
          - high SAR = energy of RF the subject receives
*** VFA: variable flip angle:
         The signal depends on the RF angle (usually 90 deg, but we don't have to)
        [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017092007-class_notes_brain_imaging_and_mri.org_20220117_154426_5VREVb.png]]
        so instead of many TRs/TIs, we can change just the angle of the first pulse.
        For small angles we get small T1s so we don't need to wait long TRs - can scan more quickly
        - we need to remember that the angle isn't actually the same across the slice, so we need to adjust for it by scanning twice with two angles (usually a and 2 x a) and creating a B1 map.

*** MSME (multi slice multi echo) aka DPFG
            - A pulse program where we gives one 90 deg pulse followed by several 180 deg pulses at intervals
            - we get several different contrasts - progressively more T2 weighted. each contrast in a different K space
            - we can use it to get various contrasts, or to calculate the actual T2 values:
              The echos become progressively weaker, because in each one we accumulate more *spin-spin interactions* which create more *dephasing*, and loss of signal. In other words - the signal between echos decays exponentially as a function of T2, and we can extract T2 from the numerical graph:

:END:
                - a way to get a fast scan that gives a weighted T2 image
                - we excite once with a 90 deg pulse then repeatedly echo with 180 deg pulses - like MSME.
                  The difference is that we change the gradient we're looking at before each echo, so we're looking at different lines in K space at each echo read. - the *same K space*
                - the samples in the center of the space  have the most information, they affect the created image the most, and so they affect the effective TE of the image ( $TE_{eff}$) the most
                - we need TE_eff because we sample each line in a different Te (after a different number of 180 pulses)
                - because of this, we can't calculate the actual T2 in the sample, but we do get the qualitative image we may want for diagnosis.
                  [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017092007-class_notes_brain_imaging_and_mri.org_20211216_192520_ay6lUG.png]]
                - the more echos we have, *the quicker we cover the slice* - but *there's a price*: the more echos, the longer we look at each slice, so we can fit less slices in between each Tr - so we get *less brain coverage*

              - this is the  pulse program do we use for SWI
                GRE - gradient echo: just a 90 deg pulse, without a 180 pulse to create the echo.
                Instead, we use  the reverse of the gradient we applied to affect and change back the phase of the signal:
                whenever we apply a gradient we create a certain amount of dephasing, since different areas inherently respond to the magnetic field slightly differently, since we know exactly what caused that dephasing we can undo it using the same field with reverse polarity
                [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017092007-class_notes_brain_imaging_and_mri.org_20211219_101815_qba5jy.png]]

                so we get the effects of *T2** when we read the signal (not just T2) - *T2** *weighted image*

              - we can use small (<90 deg) angles:
                                We don't have to use a 90 deg pulse, if we use smaller angles we'll have to wait less time between pulses, so we have a shorter Tr (and faster scans)
*** multi gradiend echo (mGRE)
                 If we give more and more alternating gradients, we get another measurement from each of them - each with a progressively longer Te.
                  the strength of the signal from each is decaying, exponentially, with time constant T2*! - *so this is the way to calculate T2** *of a sample.*

        - we usually want to suppress fat signal (but not always!)
        - we know that fat has *much shorter T1* than water
        - water has faster larmor freq than fat
        - because of the different larmor freq we know that water and fat will "dephase" at a certain rate
        - we want two points: when they are in phase (at the beginning) and when they are exactly opposite ("out of phase"). in the in phase image the signal is s= water_s + fat_s, and in the out of phase image the signal water_s - fat_s. By combining them we can get just the fat or just the water signal, e.g use hte fat signal as a mask.
        - then we can add or subtract the signals at those points to get either just fat or just water:
          [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017092007-class_notes_brain_imaging_and_mri.org_20211219_110233_wZNdIc.png]]

         "  This artifact occurs in gradient echo (GE) sequences as a result of selecting an echo time (TE) in which the fat and water spins (located in the same voxel at an interface) are out of phase, canceling each other. At 1.5 T, the 3.5 ppm difference in frequency between water and saturated fat results in cancelation of spins at 4.5 ms multiples, starting at about 2.3 ms; for example at 6.8 ms, 11.3 ms, and 15.9 ms. This artifact does not occur with spin echo (SE) sequences as the spins are rephased by the 180o refocusing gradient. "

*** DWI - diffusion weighted imaging
      - diffusion is a *micro-level process*, influenced by the microstructure, the cellular level
        So we can get, in a way, higher resolution than the voxels we usually look at
      - measuring diffusion: pulsed gradient spin echo
      - in DWI, the slower water molecules move - the stronger the signal!
        - because when a water molecules moves, they get out of phase faster
      - we apply gradients in three axes - X Y & Z
      - we apply each of them twice, to get the difference:
        [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017092007-class_notes_brain_imaging_and_mri.org_20220102_090558_SSwvyY.png]]
      - we don't have to apply all three - whichever we apply, we measure diffusion in that specific direction
      - three important parameters: gradient strength $G$, gradient duration  $\delta$, and diffusion time (time we let the water to move around between gradients) $\Delta$
      - $b$ is the _diffusion weighting factor_
        [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017092007-class_notes_brain_imaging_and_mri.org_20220102_092205_IlU72f.png]]
      - in real experiments we set only the b factor - not the gradient strength and duration - and we can extract $D$ which is the quantity that we care about
      - D is the _apparent_ diffusion coeficient: water has a single specific diffusion coef. (constant), in the brain, water diffusion is disrupted by the tissue, so what we measure is the diffusion coef inclusive of the disruption
