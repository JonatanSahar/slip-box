*  Intro
- Lab  once in 2 weeks
- Must read lab prep handbook before  there will be a quiz every lab  20% of the grade

- groups of 7, should register with someone

- The CNS is one continuous tube. we should always ask ourselves what’s the inside (=space), and what is the “side”/דופן.
- The brain is the “side” and the CSF is the “inside”
- Foramen magnum = the big hole, is the whole in the cranium through which the CNS continues into the brain.
- In humans, the foramen magnum is directly below the skull, in dogs, e.g., it is more caudal, more towards the tail. The place changes along the evolution.
- Endocranium = what’s inside the cranium/skull = brain  also grows with evolution.
- Also with evolution: gyration, the brain becomes more convoluted, to allow more of it in the same space. To allow for birthgiving.
- Also: the chewing area becomes smaller and smaller
*  The spinal chord
- goes through the vertebral foramen
- the pedicles have concave bottom and to, so when they're one on top of the other, they create the intervertebral foramen - where the nerves leave the the spinal chord:

    [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211227_103916_NSyXPZ.png]]
*** The different vertebrae along the spine:
    + 7 cervical vertebrae: C1 - C7
    + 12 thoracic vertebrae: T1 - T12
    + 5 lumbar vertebrae: L1 - L5
    + sacrum - 5 fused
    + coccyx - 4 fused
    + total 33 vertebra
    + they are numbered from rostral part to caudal (head to to tail)
- the sacrum vertebrae still have intervertebral foramen - the coccyx does not.
*** segments  of the spinal chord:
    + we can divide the spinal chord into 31 segments, each having a spinal nerve going out of it (and into it)
    + each spinal nerve has both directions!
    + why not the same number?
        + first nerve goes out just before C1, and is called C1
        + goes on till C7 - named for the vertebra that's below it
        + then C8 even though there's no C8 vertebra
        + thoracic T1 is named after vertebra above it, and so it continues
          [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211227_105130_gDU9Ew.png]]
        + also only 1 nerve for "all" the coccyx vertebrae
    + the spinal chord terminates a lot earlier than the spinal column - *around L1-L2*
    + point of termination is called  *conus medullaris*
    + in the bottom of the spinal column there are many roots making their way to their exit points.
    + this area is called cauda equina = horse tail
    + Filum terminale (= terminal film) is the rest of the pia mater continuing after the spinal chord is terminated
    + in the ara of the filum terminale down to S1-S2 there the *dural sac* full of CSF, but no spinal chord.
    + after the dural sac is the coccygeal ligament - the end of the dura and archanoid layers
    + epidural injections and LP for sampling the CSF will be done usually around L3-L4 since there's no risk of hitting the spinal chord
    + Limb enlargements:
      Areas where the spinal chord is thicker - thicker nerves, more information
      Used for areas where we have finer motor control, and higher resolution sensing.
        + cervical (neck)
            + enervates hands
        + lumbosacral (lower back)
            + enervates legs and feet
***** Gray matter of the spinal chord:
    + in the spinal chord the grey matter is on the inside, and the white matter is on the outside. In the brain, it's the opposite.
    + in the grey matter there are "dorsal horns" reaching almost to the vertebra
    + also there is a median fissure - a long deep groove on the ventral side.
    + there's a hole in the middle of the grey matter - it's the central canal, and it's full of CSF.
      [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211227_105248_XpxGaB.png]]
        - Laminae of rexed - layers in the gray matter, different cells and functions in each layer.
    + layers V, VI, VII are *decousation* layers - meaning they have to do with crossing sides, from the word deca, meaning 10, which is X in latin
      [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211227_120340_GA5aSi.png]]

*** meninges קרומי המוח (from the outside to the inside)
    + three types:
        * dura mater
        * arachnoid
        * pia mater
        [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211227_105332_SdkQBR.png]]
    + mater is mother in latin - comes from translating the original latin to arabic, where it's really called mother, and back to latin after the middle ages
    + pia mater is so thin we don't see it. It sticks to the surface of the brain, and goes into all the fissures.
    + in the brain, there's no space between the dura and the skull (in health)
    + in the spinal chord - there is space there. That space is called epidural space (epi = above)
    + between the dura and arachnoid there is the subdural space (sub = under)
    + between the arachnoid and the dura there is always space too - the subarachnoid space.
    + the subarachnoid space is filled with CSF
    + also in the subarachnoid space - the blood vessels of the brain
    + all of these exist both in the brain and in the spinal chord
      [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211227_105921_ckj0it.png]]
*** nerves of the spinal chord:
    + rootletts - going out of the spinal chord. There are ventral and dorsal rootletts.
    + rootletts collect into roots - ventral and dorsal roots, one of each.
    + roots merge into a mixed spinal nerve
    + ventral nerves carry motor information = out of the spinal chord
    + dorsal nerves carry sensory information into the spinal chord
    + DRG the dorsal root ganglion.
    + ganglion is a collection of nerve cell bodies *in the PNS*
    + the same collection in the CNS is called a *nucleous*
    + the neurons in the DRG are uni-directional (called pseudo unipolar)
      [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211227_110523_W6ZDKr.png]]
    + each nerve contains thousands or tens of thousands of neurons
    + the mixed spinal nerve *splits soon after leaving the vertebrae* - has two branches (=Rami): dorsal ramus and ventral ramus
    + both rami carry both sensory and motor (in and out) information
      [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211227_110552_Zmsm0e.png]]
    + dermatomes - division lines on the body of areas enervated by the same spinal chord segment. They make sense when we look at animals walking on four legs
      [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211227_110914_nJZHO5.png]]
      [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211227_110939_vtzxbr.png]]
    + face enervated by cranial nerves, going straight out of the brain
- denticulate ligaments - the pia leaves the grey matter and gets lodged into the dura. Maybe meant to give structural stability to the spinal chord.
*** white matter of the spinal chord:
    + the white matter is devided into three *funiculi* - frontal, lateral,ventral
        + funiculus means "cable" they look like cables from the side
        + each funiculus is divided into fasciculi
        + e.g. the dorsal(sensory) funiculus is devided into:
            + fasciculus gracillis - enervates legs
            + fasciculus cuneatus - enervates hands
        + fasciculus comes from fascia/fasces - the roman bunch of twigs
    + schematically we may say that:
        + lateral areas enervate the arms
        + medial areas enervate legs
        + and in between areas enervate the trunk
        + dorsal areas are sensory
        + ventral areas are motor
    + The higher we are in the spinal chord there's more white matter, because all the information tracks/ nerves that go in/out of the brain come together
    + in the lower segments there aren't really any lateral horns
    + reflex arc:
        + when there's enough activation in the sensing area, the information travels to the dorsal root ganglion and the sensory nerve cell bodies there.
        + if there's enough activation, the sensory neuron will activate the adjoining motor neuron in the ventral horn (through an interneuron) - directly, without waiting for information from the brain.
        + we can choose to premeditatively inhibit the reflex, through inhibition of the interneuron
        + this inhibition is dependent on the magnitude of the stimulus
* Embryology
*** 1st week - blastocyst
[[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211227_120839_EU676x.png]]
- On the day of conception, there is a zygote
- This cell begins to split exponentially
- On days 4-5 the Morula
- On Day 5-6 the blastocyst forms
    + This contains the embryoblast (the fetus forms from this) inside and the trophoblast which creates the membrane (go on to form structures external to the fetus)
- The blastocyst cavity is the space within the blastocyst

*** 2nd week - bilaminar disk
[[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211227_120927_kcozm2.png]]
During week 2 the embryoblast divides into the Bilaminar Ebryionic Disk which costsists of epiblast and hypoblast cells

*** 3rd week gastrulation
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       20211227T122019.739935
:END:
- moving from 2 layer disk to 3 layer disk
- primitive streak, develops along the midline, caudal to rostral.
- primitive node leading the change
- invagination of the epiblast
- the epiblast cells *replace* all of the hypoblast cells (they were only usued for support during the first weeks)
- 3 layers:
    1. ectoderm - outer
       Skin, hair, and *nervous system*
    2. mesoderm - inner
       Muscles and skeleton
    3. endoderm - inner
       Internal organs
- invaginating cells are pluripotent - they can develop into any and all types of cells.
  [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211227_122307_AAakHI.png]]
*** neurulation
          - 4th week (6th week of pregnancy)
          - the ectoderm separates into ectoderm and neuro-ectoderm
          - neuro-ectoderm develops into the neural plate
***** the notochord
              + develops from the primitive node (caudal) to the rostral area
              + the spinal column and spinal chord will develop from it
              + a part of the endoderm - will become a part of the mesoderm
              + signals a lot of developmental factors by secretion
              + induces development of neural part of ectoderm - called *neural plates*
              + in the middle of the spinal chord there's a small hall/tunnel - that's the remainder of the notochord
***** the neural tube
              + neural plates invaginate and close to create the *neural tube*
            [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211227_124357_arcBvD.png]]
              - closes from the cervical area (middle of the spine) towards both ends
              - leaves two neuropores - anterior and posterior, they close after 25 days or so
              - can have pathologies when not closing properly:
                  - anencephaly - anterior
                  - spina bifida - 3 kinds:
                    [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211227_191601_nR11Rp.png]]
          - the rest of the non-neural ectoderm covers the neural tube from above
          - betewen the ectoderm and the neural tube there's the neural crest - which used to be the outer border of the neural plate:
            [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211227_191435_zox8yp.png]]
          - neural tube --> the CNS
          - the neural crest --> the PNS
          - somites - muscles and bones
***** development of the spinal chord
      - from the neural tube
      - dorsal part - alar plate (from wings) - will develop into sensory neurons
      - ventral part - basal plate - will develop into motor neurons
      - between them: the sulcus limitans
      - roof plate - dorsal
      - floor plate - ventral
      - ependimal cells - line the neural plate from within
      - so the neural tube becomes an actual hollow tube
      - as time goes by - there are more cells, and the hollow part becomes smaller
***** development of the brain
      The rostral part of the neural tube doesn't stay as a regular tube:
      - it segments into three parts (vesicles):
          1. prosencephalon (pros = frontal)
          2. mesencephalon (mes = missle)
          3. rhombencephalon (rhomb = rhomboid = מעוין)
      - 5 vesicles stage:
        The front brain splits in to, the hindbrain splits in two, and the midbrain continues on as midbrain (mesencephalon)
          1. *telencephalon* - mostly cortex
          2. *diencephalon* - mostly the thalamus
          3. mesencephalon - the midbrain
          4. metencephalon - cerebllum and pons
          5. myelencephalon - medula oblongata
          - the eyes (the retina) are part of the CNS! They develop from the diencephalon
      - the neural tube starts to fold - creating the structure of the brain
        [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211227_192542_iySHRz.png]]
      - *gyrification* - the telencephalon starts to invaginate, "in order" to get more tissue into the same volume of skull
      - the temporal and frontal poles grow further and further apart, the temporal pole goes backwards, and then laterally - *creating the C shape of many of the structures of the brain*
      - falx medialis - a dura that grows between the two hemispheres - that's why they grow to be flat on the medial aspect. Flax - מגל
      - pathologies: when the two vesicles don't separate
          - holoencephalon - no telencephalon, but we do get the outside of the cortex, just empty
          - cyclopia
* Topography of the brain
*** cerebrum - the big brain
            - longitudinal fissure - between the hemispheres
            - five lobes:
              - frontal
              - parietal - from the greek for wall (paries)
              - occipital - from "back of head"
              - temporal - from tempo, time, where age is first notices in the graying hair (of george clunney)
*** brainstem
            - midbrain
            - pons
            - medulla oblongata
*** cerebllum - the small brain
*** four main features of the lobes - good for orientation:
            - central sulcus (rolandic fissure)
            - temporal sulcus (sylvian fissure)
            - paraieto-occipital sulcus - not seen well from the temporal view
            - preoccipital notch
- corpus callosum - white matter conencting the hemispheres, lit. Large body (of white matter)
- fornyx - ventral to the corpus callosum
- lateral ventricles - dorsal and lateral to the fornyx
- third ventricle - below the fornix
*** mid-sagital plane
***** thalamus
- evolves from the diencephalon (the cortex develops from the telencephalon)
- anything with -thalamus in the name also develops from the diencephalon
- relay station from all senses excep olefactory
- inter-thalamic adhesion connecting R and L thalami
- septum pellucidum - divides the two lateral ventricles.  stretched between corpus callosum and the fornyx
***** hypothalamus
- below and to the front of the thalamus
- mammillary body is a part of the hypothalamus
***** the pituitary gland, outside of the brain, but continuous with the hipothalamus.
- anterior part develops from the non-nueonal ectoderm
- posterir part (=neuorhypophysis) is part of the thalamus itself, develops from the neural tube
- from the posterior pituitary hormones - oxytocin and vasopressin
- from the anterior part - other hormones
***** pineal gland
  - secretes melatonin, syncs our biological clock.
*** ventral view
***** olfactory system:
- bulb
- tract
- lateral stria
- medial stria (unused in humans?)
- uncus (main processing area for smell in the cortex)
***** Optic:
- nerve
- chiasma
- tract
***** Pituitary Gland
- vetral to the chiasma
***** orbital gyri (above the eye socket)
***** rectus (straight) gyri
* white matter and connections
*** Development
          - at the beginning the vesicles are empty - the neural tube is just the wall of the tube
          - telencephalon grows much more than the rest, and the convolustions start taking up the internal space
          - the *lamina terminalis* is the anterior-most part of the telencephalon when it develops (as it grows, other parts become more rostral/anterior than the lamina terminalis)
            [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211227_223330_9QrJz8.png]]
          - the space is filled with CSF (CSF is very similar to the blood plasma)
          - the wall becomes thicker and thicker (becomes neurons = gray matter, cell bodies)
            [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211227_223439_LrFYgn.png]]
          - the space becomes filled with two types of tissue:
              + neurons:
                  Neurons send axons - white matter, and they do it in bunches - nerve fibers/tracts
              + subcortical nuclei (= non cortical gray matter)
*** White matter:
      - centrum semiovale- like it sounds - general name for the white matter
***** projection fibers - connect the cortex with non-cortex structures
                  - corticopetal - into the cortex
                  - corticofugal - out of the cortex
******* corona radiata - the "fan" of white matter
[[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211227_224708_AwVpr3.png]]
                    - seen on the sagital plain/lateral section, but not medial, slightly off-center
                    - the lower, ventral, part is called the internal capsule  the fibers come together and become more dense.
********* the internal capsule
                      - "hidden" by the lentiform nucleous (when looking from the side)
                      - on the horizontal section (from above) - has five parts:
                          1. anterior limb
                          2. genu
                          3. posterior limb
                          4. retrolenticular part - fibers going caudally towards the occipital lobe - also called the *optic radiation*
                          5. sublenticular part - the *auditory radiation* - going into the auditory cortex
                      - medial to the internal capsule is the *thalamus*
                      - summary of connections from the internal capsule:
                          - Anterior limb
                              - Thalamo-cortical fibers to the frontal lobes
                              - Cortico-striatal fibers
                              - Cortico-pontine fibers
                              - Thalami-pontine fibers
                              - Connections between the lentiform and Caudate
                          - Genu

                          - Posterior limb
                              - Corticospinal fibers
                              - Sensory fibers (mainly from the medial lemniscus tract)
                          - Retrolenticular part
                              - Optic Radiation (geniculocalcarine tract)
                          - Sublenticular part
                              - Auditory pathway (from MGB to primary auditory cortex)
                      - external capsule
                      - extreme capsule
***** commissural fibers - between hemispheres
              - develop from the telencephalon impart - the part middle part of the telencephalon that doesn't separate, stays between the two vesicles growing to the sides
              - Anterior Commissures
                  - Anterior commissure
                      - just above to the lamina terminalis (the frontmost part of the developing telencephalon)
                      - connects the two temporal lobes
                  - Hippocampal commissure
                  - Corpus Callosum
                      - grows to take up most of the telencephalon impart
                      - *forceps minor* - fibers going through the genu (מלקחיים) - connecting areas in the frontal lobes - going rostrally from the Cps Colsm
                      - *forceps major* - fibers going through the splenium (מלקחיים) - connects visual areas in the occipital lobe - going caudally from the Cps Colsm
                      - *tapetum* - fibers going around (laterally) the lateral ventricles (coating them like a tapestry טפט)

                  - Posterior commissure
                  - Habenular commissure
***** association fibers - intra (inside)hemispheric
              - short fibers
                  - between neighboring gyri
              - long fibers - also called fasciculi (sing. fasciculus)
[[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211229_114457_uP6NGF.png]]
                  - usually between lobes
                  - like a road, not all axons have to go all the way through, they can leave the fasciculus anywhere
                  - supirior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF)
                    C shaped, from frontal to temporal lobes
                      + arcuate fasciculus - part of the SLF, connecting Broca and Wernicke areas
                  - uncinate fasciculus - also frontal-temporal, but from the front
                  - infirior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF)
                    Temporal - occipital connection
                  - infirior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF)
                  - Cingulum inside the cingulate gyrus
                    From the subcallosal area all the way around to the uncus in the temporal gyrus
*** corpus striatum (striped body)
***** develops from the telencephalon - from an area of growth it the rear of the telencephalon - along with the rest of the  *basal nuclei*
***** white matter fibers growing down from the developing cortex *divide* the growing striatum (almost) into two parts
***** from the lateral mass of the striatum will develop the *lentiform nucleous* (from lentil - עדשה) and from the medial mass - the *caudate nucleous*
***** the lentiform sits "inside" the internal capsule
***** the caudate grows "above" (dorsally to) the thalamus before it wraps around the internal capsule of the corona radiata
***** the medial mass elongates dorsally, and wraps around the white matter - the corona radiata, back in a lateral direction - this the "tail" (caudate)
*** basal nuclei (subcortical nuclei):
          - most notably - related to motor functions (but also more)
***** striatum
              - caudate nucleous (see above)
              - nucleus accumbens (see above)
                                  connects the caudate and the lentiform
******* lentiform nucleous
                        [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211229_112304_GDtUfX.png]]
                      - Putamen
                          + connects to the accumbens, more similar to caudate in function
                      - globus pallibus (pale ball)
                          + more similar to brainstem in function
                          + internus - GPi
                          + externus - GPe
***** layers of gray and white matter
                - [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211229_113501_byBXHH.png]]
                - laterally to the lentiform there's a thin sheet of white matter called the *external capsule*
                - laterally to that, there's a sheet of gray matter called the clasutrum
                - laterally to that there's another sheet white matter called the *extream capsule*
***** two divisions of basal nuclei:
              - a functional & embriological division of the nuclei puts the putamen with the caudate and divides between the striatum and the pallibus
              - an anatomical division divides between the caudate and the lentiform
***** subthalamic nucleous (also develops from the diencephalon)
***** substantia nigra - part of the brainstem
                    - pars reticulata - SNr
                    - pars compacta (the black part) SNc
                        + secrete dopamin
                        + dopamin can be either inhibitory or excitatory depending on the post-synaptic neuron:
                            - D1 receptors create excitation
                            - D2 create inhibition
***** Thalamus and the motor system
******* divisions: (then more subdivisions)
                    [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211229_120553_dSKG8Q.png]]
********* anterior nuclei
********* medial nuclei
********* lateral nuclei
            - activates the cortex
            - *SNr and GPi are thalamus inhibitors*
            - the pyramidal system - two neurons from cortex to muscle - this is not enough for fine grained control
******* extra-pyramidal system
                  - works with agonist-antagonist pairs of muscles
                  - this is the role of the basal nuclei
                  - the VA (ventral-medial) and VL (ventral lateral) thalamic nuclei are involved in planning and initialtion of movement
********* The extrapyramidal system has two pathways:
                        [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211229_124237_phIYw7.png]]
                                 - both pathways operate all the time creating a balance of inhibition and activation of the thalamus = of movement initiation commands, and of the magnitude/strength of activation. This way we can create very gentle and precise movements
*********** direct - *for voluntary action*
                                - the striatum (caudate and putamen) inhibits the GPi and the SNr
                                - the GPi  and the SNr  inhibit the thalamus
                                - the thalamus activates the cortex
                                - the direct path is when the cortex activates the striatum, causing the it to inhibit GPi/SNr -> they stop inhibiting the thalamus -> the thalamus is free to activate the cortex - to tell it to initiate a movement.
*********** indirect - *reduces/inhibits unwanted movement*
                                    - the cortex activates the striatum (STR) - specifically an inhibtory neuron connected to the GPe
                                    - GPe usually inhibits the subthalamic nucleous
                                    - subthalamic nucleous activates GPi/SNr (which are thalamic inhibitors)
                                    - CTX activates STR --> STR inhibits GPe --> causes activation of subthalamic nucleous --> activates GPi/SNr --> inhibit thalamus --> no movement commands
********* role of SNc in thalamus activation:
                        - in the direct pathway, the SNc neurons are connected to the putamen through D1 (=excitatory neurons), so they *support* the direct (=activating) pathway = *supporting movment*
                        - in the indirect pathway SNc neurons connect to the putamen through D2 neurons (=inhibitory) neurons. Since putamen activation eventually inhibits movement, this means the *the SNc inhibits the indirect pathway*, and _supports movement_.
                        - so *SNc always supports movemnt!*
                        - that's the main problem in parkinson's disease - the initiation of movement
                        - hemiballismus - a malfunction in the mechanism of inhibition (caused by damage to the subthalamic nucleous) in some motor pathways, that causes ballistic (large and fast) movements in some body parts
                        - chorea - another symptom of damage to the basla nuclei - causes many large movements in the whole body (looks like dancing)
                        - *exam questions: what would happen if we damage any of the components of either pathway?*
*** the ventricles:
              - two lateral ventricles - separated by the septum pellucidum
              - third in the middle
              - septum pellucidum develops from two septums, that usually merge before birth
***** third ventricle - rubber chicken head.
******* has an eye and recesses created by pineal gland and more
***** choroid plexus
                    made of blood vessels and pia - filters out the red and white blood cells and elts only the plasma through to make the CSF
* Histology
        - how the tissue looks
*** histology of the cortex:
*****  Neocortex
                - new, in evolutionary terms
                - the great majority of the human cortex
******* 6 layers of cells, based on the way the tissue looks
                  1. Molecular - almost no cell bodies, mostly connections

                  2. External Granular - connect other cortical areas in the same hemisphere
                  3. External Pyramidal - mostly connect to the other hemisphere

                  4. Internal granular - gets all the input from the thalamus
                  5. Internal Pyramidal - mostly sends towards the brainstem. Here there are the primary motor neurons (Beltz cells)

                  6. Multiform - mostly towards the thalamus
******* divided into columns - each col. contains all the layers, columns are usually responsible for some function
******* there is no clear physical boundary - but sometimes moving a 0.5 cm to the one side moves a different finger for example.
******* Bordmann areas - in different areas of the cortex, the distribution of the layers is different. the columns have substantially different function subserved by different layer structure.
********* examples:
*********** primary sensory areas get a lot of sensory input from tehe thalamus, so it has a thicvker layer IV
*********** association cortex אסוציאטיבי: multimodal representation of concepts - inputs from many types of areas - has a rather balanced struvture
*********** primary motor cortex: has almost no sensory input, so no layer IV, but huge pyramidal neurons, so very thick layer V.

***** Allocortex - not new
******* Paleocortex - old, very old
********* 4-5 layers
*********  Olfactory System (olfactory bulb; olfactory tubercle; piriform cortex)
********* Parahippocampal gyrus
******* Archicortex - archi=first, so oldest in evolutionary terms
********* 3 layers
********* Hippocampus
* functional localization
*** general division
          - Primary Cortex
              * the area where the representation is the closest to what exists at the periphery
              * for the motor pathway - the last stop before the brainstem/spinal chord
              * for sensory input - the first stop on the way in
          - Secondary Cortex
              * a higher representation than primary cortex
          - Associative Areas
              * combining information from different modalities
              * concepts
              * sensory-motor feedback/correction?
*** the motor cortex
        - primary motor cortex - M1
            - BA (brodmann area) 4
            - no internal granular layer, i.e. No layer IV ("agranular cortex")
        - secondary/associative motor cortex
            - Premotor (=before, more frontal than motor) Cortex  - BA 6
                + generation/execution of a motor plan (high level like walking)
                + activates and coordinates neurons in M1
            - SMA supplamentary motor area - in the most medial part of the premotor cortex, also folds into the medial surface - also BA 6
                + planning movement - activates the motor plan in the premotor cortex
                + anticipation of external conditions relating to the movement - like the trajectory of a ball we want to hit
            - Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
                + error detection (not only motor!)
            - frontal eye field (FEF)
                + synchronizes the movement of the eyeballs so it's consistent with the rest of our movement and where we put our attention - lower part of BA 8
***  the somatosensory cortext
            - primary sensory cortex - S1
                + BA 1, 2, 3
                + postcentral gyrus
            - secondary sensory cortex
                + BA 5, 7, 40
            - damage to associative sensory areas:
                - tactile agnosia (types:)
                    - astereognosis - inability to recognize objects by touch. (Though no problem using them)
*** the visual cortex:
          - BA 17
          - around and inside the calcarine sulcus
          - aka the striate cortex
          - stria of gennari
***** laterality
        - the right optic nerve has information from the left visual field and vice versa
        - from the eye to the LGN
        - from there, through the internal capsule and the optic radiation, to V1
        - each LGN has information from *both* eyes, the left (right) side of each of them:
          [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211219_164435_RLHHXU.png]]
        - the LGN has 6 layers.
*****  V1 organization
              - is retinotopic, but inverse:
                  + what's high on the visual field arrives at the bottom of V1:
                    [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211219_164745_Oe44iC.png]]
                  + meyer's loop: fibers of the upper visual field go through the temporal lobe - "backwards" (more ventral) from the thalamus, and only then to V1 (see above)
                  + what's outside, is represented deepest and most "inside" in the cortex
              - simple cells: neurons that respond to lines in one particular orientation, in one particular location across the visual field.
              - complex cells: respond to the orientation regardless of location
***** secondary/associative areas:
              - in secondary areas we have neurons that respond to collections of lines in various orientations: shapes
              - gradually, hierarchially, becomes more complex
              - mostly in BA 18 & 19, to the sides of BA 17
              - [[/mnt/g/My Drive/.notes.v2/slip-box/20211017161734-class_notes_brain_structure.org_20211219_170204_KAyMG5.png]]
              - two streams:
                  + ventral  "what"- inferior temporal lobe
                  + dorsal "where" - parietal lobe - close to the somatosensory cortex
***** damages:
******* prosopagnosia - face blindness - the man who thought his wife was a hat
******* right hemisphere is more active for face recognition
*** the gustatory cortex
        - taste: BA 43
        - bottom of the central sulcus
*** the olfactory cortex
        - smell: BA 34 (uncus
        - perhaps the most ancient sense
        - no relay station like the thalamus, directly from the nose to the uncus - through *the olfactory trigon*
        - Closely linked to the limbic system
         - Extends to the Limen of the Insula and Amygdala
*** the auditory cortex
***** BA 41 and 42
***** superior part of the temporal lobe, bending inwards towards the insula (hescel's convolustion):
