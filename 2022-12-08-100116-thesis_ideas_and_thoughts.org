#+title: Thesis ideas and thoughts
- [[id:20220929T131701.371065][tag: thesis]]

Anything that has to do with my own thoughts and ideas about the project - ideas fro analyses, their meaning, connecting suff from literature, preparing for writing.

* What are we talking about?
- The difference in modulation of the auditory cortex between ipsi and contralateral hand playing.
- The (mechanism of the) effect of action on perception - on processing in fact.
    + The effect of action on the processing of the action's consequences
- Efference copies and how they work.
- Crosstalk between sensori and motor circuits
- Sensorimotor integration.

* Why does it matter?
- can say something about the mechanism of [[id:20221208T101618.833052][Efference copy]] efferent copies (look at [cite:@buaronVoluntaryActionsModulate2020])  for language about efferent copies and the connection.


* Literature connections
- both reznik papers ([cite:@reznikEnhancedAuditoryEvoked2015;@reznikLateralizedEnhancementAuditory2014])  show that there's more modulation of the auditory cortex when the hand is ipsilateral to the ear .
- this is also supported by batel's visual paper ([cite:@buaronVoluntaryActionsModulate2020]) showing the same for hand-and-visual-field.

* Introduction ideas
** goals
- need to put my research in a broader context
- need to show I know what's going on in the field
- need to help someone not from the field understand the work and its importance

** specifics
- connections between action and perception (both ways, include david schalmer's paper)
    + sensori-motor integration
- specifically how action modultes perception
- efference copy
- theory of event codes (TEC)
