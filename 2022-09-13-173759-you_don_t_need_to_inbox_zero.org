From [[id:20220913T173829.326027][Time management for humans]].
We tend to bind ourselves to the obligation to "clear the decks" - to finish taking care of all the little tasks that we have beore we feel that we're free to do what we really want and what is important for us.

Don't do that.

It's better to give into the fact that you'll *never* be able to complete all of these tasks - because there is literally an infinite amount of them just waiting to be queued up.
It's better to embrace this fact, to let the anxiety of unfinised tasks just be there, a part of life, like it is whether you like it or not.

What to do instead?
Leave the "cleanining up" for the end of the day times where you have less energy etc. And keep the morning for the projects that you actually care about and want to invest in.
