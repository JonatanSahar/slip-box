#+title: Reward improves online correction in motor learning
[[cite:&manoharMotivationDynamicallyIncreases2019]] and [[cite:&galeaDissociableEffectsPunishment2015]] show that [[id:20220221T160259.019621][Reward improves motor performance]], and they think that part of the mechanism is that there is more moment-by-moment correction during the movement.

They show this by using [[id:20220221T170457.279171][time-time correlations]] - where low correlation between the start of the movement and any points during the movement are taken to mean subjects are not following a pre-decided "template" movement, but are sensitive to what happens in the moment and so the movement changes dynamically.
