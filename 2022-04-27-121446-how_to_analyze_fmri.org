#+title: How to analyze fMRI


* connect to the MRI center file
***** Other locations in file manager
***** smb://mrilabfs.tau.ac.il/mri_XX_lab$
***** username/password - same as in TAU


* Order the data on my computer:
*** BIDS  folder structure
The standard way to order and share imaging data
https://bids.neuroimaging.io/

Batel has a script for that :)

* types of scans
***** Mprage - anatomical
***** cmrr - functional
***** each scan name contains the number of volumes, and a name we can choose
***** there's an _sbref scan for each scan: used for motion correction, we don't use it usually
***** each dicom is 3D at a given Tr
***** use the 2nd mprage dir - has been filtered
* analyzing with FSL
Can open individual tools from command line - for GUI, call tool with capital letter (otherwise is calls the function directly)
*** BET
    Extract the brain only
    need to do only once - for the anatomical data, FEAT later uses it
    give it the anatomical DICOM

*** FEAT - first level
***** Data:
            Preprocessing & GLM analysis
            first level: single run
            second level: multiple runs
            group analysis
            fulle analyis = inc. running a GLM
            highpass filter = 100HZ

***** pre-stats
            Keep defaults, and add slice time correction = interleaved

***** registration
            For main functional image - select anatomical_brain image (from BET)
            For the standard space -  use full search & 12 DOF

***** Stats
            Need to create an EVs (events) files for every kind of event that happend in the scan, with fields:
            - onset
            - duration
            - weight

            Setting up the GLM: choose "Full model  setup"
            create a page for each EV
            custom 3 column format
            HRF: double gamma
            define contrasts in 2nd tab

***** post-stats = multi comparisons correction
            Don't need for first-level - set to "none"

***** save!  before hitting go
            Creates a "batch" file : .fsf

***** go
            Creates a folder with a .feat suffix
            Creates a FEAT report html that updates in real time:
            - registration: shows the quailty of registration
            - pre-stats: motion correction data
            - stats: the details of the statistical model etc.
            - Post-stats: multiple comparisons info, if we chose to let it run that for us (we don't it doesn't have FDR correction)

            Can run from command line as "feat path/to/design.fsf"

***** load
            load an existing .fsf file
            can create an empty .fsf with names of vars in "", and then populate file with a script


***** output:
            Work with filtered_Func_data feed into FSLeye

            cope files: the different contrasts we computed: we can use them later for the higher order analysis.

            in stat directory:
            - pe*.nii: the beta value for each event* in EVs: NIFTI files with the beta value for each voxel
            - tstat*.nii.gz - the t-values for each voxel

            In reg directory:
            Feat doen't apply the transformation to MNI - the coomputations for doing so are in reg dir.

            Also in reg - hires_head - the anatomical head

*** FEAT - higher level
    Analyze multiple runs from the same esubject
    input the cope files from previous analysis of all runs
    averages the different run + transforms to MNI space

*** FSLeyes
    Presentation of images

*** dcm2nii - external app
    Convert DICOM to NIFTI
