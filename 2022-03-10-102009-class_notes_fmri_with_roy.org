#+title: Class notes: fMRI with Roy

* physiology of fMRI
*** hemodynamic response - following neural activity
***** first a decrease in oxidated HB
***** then a rapid increase of oxidated HB
******* due  to increase blood flow
***** more oxidated HB = less magnetic interruption = less dephasing  = more signal
***** neurophysiological recording primer:
******* single cell recordings
********* high freqs
*********** AP
********* low freqs
*********** synaptic activity = graded potential
***** which neural activity?
******* action potential?
******* graded potential?
******* excitatory or inhibitory?
******* correlating fMRI with electrophysiologics
********* human fMRI to monkey electrophysiologics
*********** visual cortex, contrast of images
*********** logothtis 2001
************* standing fMRI for monkeys
************* correlation of fMRI with
*************** spikes
*************** multi unit activity
*************** local field potentials
************* also correlation with negative fMRI
***************** decrease in BOLD signal in areas unrelated to the task
********* Roy's doctoral work - humans
*********** correlation of fMRI and intracranial recording
*********** fMRI and electro from different patients
*********** auditory area while watching a film clip - the good the bad and the ugly
********* ECoG
*********** same film the good the bad and the ugly
*********** visual cortex, same patients
*********  convolution:
*********** replace each spike with the hemodynamic response
************* get the sum of HRFs - use as estimate model of expected (actual) HRF
*********** or using the LFP
************* high freq band
*** fMRI resolution
***** depends on capillary diameter
******* at most 2-3 mm
*****  technology allows resolution of 1mm (^3) while still scanning the whole brain
***** signals are highly correlated in neighboring voxels
