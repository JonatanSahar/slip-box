#+title: Notes on Sato, Action Observation Modulates Auditory Perception of the Consequence of Othersâ€™ Actions

#[[id:20220929T131701.371065][Thesis]]

* summary and short reference
An experiment aiming to show that attenuation through the (putative) forward-model is not limited to our own actions, but happens in action observation scenarios as well - this means that the attenuation is related to prediction rather than being an effect of agency.

* general notes
