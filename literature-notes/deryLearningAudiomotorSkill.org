#+title: Notes on Dery, Mukamel, Learning of Audio-motor Skill Is Sensitive to the Lateral Relationship between Trained Hand and Ear

* general notes
Behavioral study
Task: learn a piano sequence in one hand with auditory feedback  to either L or R hand.
4 groups: RH ipsi, RH contra, LH ipsi, LH contra.

*** Main findings:
 *better learning in the contralateral condition (both hands).*

*better cross-education (LH --> RH) for the contra group:*

*** Literature
Auditory and motor functions are connected through audio-motor representations. This is seen through "auditory mirror neurons" - e.g. After learning a melody, hearing the same melody (but not another made from the same notes) brings about activity in motor circuits, and also MEP (motor evoked potentials) associated with the fingers, even anticipating note onset.
