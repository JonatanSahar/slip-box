#+title: Notes on Scott, Optimal Feedback Control and the Neural Basis of Volitional Motor Control

* general notes

 M1 receives a rich mixture of sensory feedback from the motor periphery, with many neurons responding strongly to passive joint movements or skin contact.

* summary and short reference
A review paper.

They want to connect what we know about the three levels of motor function:
- neural control in M1
- the mechanics of moving the limbs, muscle, skeletone and all
- the "motor behavior", organizing movement around function.
