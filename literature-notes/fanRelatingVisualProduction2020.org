* general notes
Highly relevant

fMRI study

they had subjects look at 4 objects - not shapes - inside the magnet before and after training to draw only two of them. They found that there was better discrimination (decoding) between the objects they learned how to draw.

They also scanned them while they were training and found that there was engagement of visual areas while they were drawing even when the picture was no longer displayed

    maintenance of recently learned information (Wammes et al., 2016) and enhanced recognition of novel symbols (Longcamp et al., 2008; James and Atwood, 2009; Li and James, 2016).

    enhanced activation in visual cortex when viewing previously practiced letters (James and Gauthier, 2006; James, 2017),

    increased connectivity between visual and parietal regions following handwriting experience (Vinci-Booher et al., 2016).
