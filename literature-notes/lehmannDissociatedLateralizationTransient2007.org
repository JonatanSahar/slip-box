#+title: Notes on Lehmann, Herdener, Schneider, Federspiel, Bach, Esposito, di Salle, Scheffler, Kretz, Dierks, Seifritz, Dissociated Lateralization of Transient and Sustained Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent Signal Components in Human Primary Auditory Cortex

* general notes


* summary and short reference
They look at the transient vs sustained parts of the BOLD signal and show that the transient part is in fact bilateral, while the sustained part shows contralateral activation.

They used monaural stimulation.

They say that  it's important to analyse the transient and sustained parts separately  (see [cite:@foxTransientBOLDResponses2005] for specifically blocked-design relevant considerations)

[cite:@wangSustainedFiringAuditory2005] say (single unit, mokeys) that the transient part of the response is a larger population of neurons responding to the onset of a sound, and the sustained part is due to the more specialized populationof nurons that is tuned to that frequency.
