#+title: Notes on Hemeren, Thill, Deriving Motor Primitives Through Action Segmentation

* summary and short reference
They use a motion capture glove to display clips of actions (drinking from cup, pouring from bottle..) to subjects in an fMRI experiment.
The clips are are either right side up with the image of the object shown or inverted with the object  not shown - so in this condition it's pretty impossible to discern what the action actually is:

Subjects are asked to "segment" the clips as they see fit.
The segmentation is compared to the kinematic profile (velocity, acceleration, angle change) .

They found that:
1. There was consistent segmentation between the conditions
2. There was a good match between the kinematics and the segmentation - they conclude that we understand actions through bottom up processing.
