#+title: Notes on Verrel, Almagor, Schumann, Lindenberger, K\uhn, Changes in Neural Resting State Activity in Primary and Higher-Order Motor Areas Induced by a Short Sensorimotor Intervention Based on the Feldenkrais Method

* summary and short reference
Eilat did a 3 minute artificial floor FI on subjects in an fMRI.
They did a RS before, after and during the intervention, as well as scans while subjects pushed with their food standing:

The artificial floor was either directed to explore local movement possibilities in the foot, or to explore the relation between the foot and higher areas along the body.

Comparing the difference in activity between pushing and rest in the while brain between the different time points - they found significant differences for post-local>post global and for baseline > post-local.
However, an ROI based search didn't find any significant clusters for activation during pushing.

They found the ReHo increased in different areas from baseline to either post-local or post-global
comparing ReHo directly between post-local and post-global also found a significant cluster.

They didn't find significant differences in brain activity during pushing between post-local and post-global.
