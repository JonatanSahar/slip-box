#+title: Notes on Rodriguez, Laio, Clustering by Fast Search and Find of Density Peaks
* main points
- clustering based on distance between points
- able to detect non spherical clusters
- finds the correct no. Of clusters automagically
- uses local maxima in density to decide on cluster centers
- they say that the algo is sensitive only to the relative values of the density $\rho_i$ - and is robust to the choice of $d_c$ - but why is that so? If we choose a large enough value we'll get the same density for all points
- how the algorithm works:
    + they measure two quanitities for each point:
        - the density
        - the min distance to a point that has a higher density
    + the idea is that points nearer the center of a cluster will bcome progressively more dense, and so their distancefrom ooints of even higher denisty will become smaller and smaller (imagine rings of equal denisty around the center, $\delta_i$ is the distance to the next ring). When we get to the center there's nowhere higher to go in the vicinity -g the next point with a higher denisty will be somewhere in another cluster.
    + $\Rightarrow$ they take as cluster centers points that are anomalous in the $\delata - \rho$ graph:

    + after that they assign points to clusters such that each point belongs to the same cluster as its closest higher-density neighbor
    + after that, they look at the border of each cluster - which is all the points that belong to that cluster, and are also closer than some distance $d_c$ to the center of any other cluster: they find the point on the border that the highest density, and they divide the cluster based on that value - every point with a higher density is considered in the core cluster, and any point with lower denistyis "in the halo" = considered to be noise.
