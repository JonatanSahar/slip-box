* general notes
*** How we hear pitch?
Inner hair cells are required for hearing - outer hair cells are modulators of the basillar membrane (affect the the way we hear sounds)

There are potassium channels in the hair cells: when the hairs move to one direction the gates open more, and the cells depolarize - increasing the firing rate, and when the move the other way, the gates close, the cells polarize and the firing rate decreases.

Because of the structure of the cochlea - a snail like structre - the amount of bending in the basal membrane is differnet in different points along the cochlea and for different frequencies: for a give frequency, a specific point witll be the one which is being bent the most by a sound of that frequency.

For most of the frequency range we have a "place code" - meaning that neurons with dendrites at a given point in the cochlea code for the frequency which most affects that point.
For low frequencies we rely directly on the frequency of the oscillations in firing rate created by the sound.

Each hemisphere gets auditory information from both ears, but primarily from the /contralateral/ one.

The auditory information is relayed to the [[id:20220929T101221.395488][Cerebellum]] and the [[id:20221006T143624.358385][Reticuar formation]] as well.

*** The auditory cortex is made up of three main areas:
[[file:g:/My Drive/notes/slip-box/literature-notes/carlsonPhysiologyBehavior11th.org_20221006_145127_JR864O.png]]
- the core region/primary auditory cortex
- the belt - a secondary/associative cortex
  Receives information from both A1 and directly from parts of the lateral lemniscus
- the parabelt -
Receives information from both the belt region and directly from (same) parts of the lateral lemniscus



*** Auditory processing is done in two streams - like visual processing:
- the anterior stream
    + Begines in the anterior parabelt
    + Processes complex sounds

- the posterior stream
    + Begines in the posterior parabelt
    + Processes localization of sounds

*** the auditory pathway is especially configured for fast and accurate transmission of the signal
- large synaptic buttons
- special low-threshold  voltage gated channles
- especially fast neurotransmitter-gated channels
-  synapses connect to the cell's soma, not dendrites (short transmissiondistance)

- Theses create very short and strong action potentials (that can respond to rapid changes)

*** dorsal (=where) streams of visual and auditory systems converge in the parietal lobe, and also in the vlPFC
- localization through combining auditory-visual information
- matching an object with the sound that it makes

*** babies are already able to hear music in much the same way as we do
- respond to key changes
- respond to dissonant music
