#+title: Notes on James, Atwood, The Role of Sensorimotor Learning in the Perception of Letter-like Forms: Tracking the Causes of Neural Specialization for Letters

* general notes
Training on novel pseudoletters - writing, typing and viewing

they found that in the writing group there was more brain activation in response to trained vs untrained pseudoletters *in areas that are known to respond to letters as well* - both in writing and reading (there was no activation of those areas in the pre-train scan)

Also included online testing as part of the training
Also had null result for behavior, but did have results
for imaging

Suggest this supports a role for motor system in the development and specialization of ventral (what) stream of visual system

    "there are brain areas specialized for processing letters." (James and Atwood 2009:92)

    "we explore the emergence of this pattern of response in the ventral processing stream through a training paradigm" (James and Atwood 2009:92)

    "the integration of sensorimotor systems through writing" (James and Atwood 2009:92)

    "leads to functional specialization in the visual system" (James and Atwood 2009:92)

    "before and after three different types of training" (James and Atwood 2009:92)

    "writing, typing, or purely visual practice" (James and Atwood 2009:92)

    "Results suggested that only after writing practice did neural activation patterns to pseudoletters resemble patterns seen for letters." (James and Atwood 2009:92)

    "suggesting that in some areas, any motor experience may change visual processing." (James and Atwood 2009:92)

    "an intimate interaction among perceptual and motor systems during pseudoletter perception that may be extended to everyday letter perception" (James and Atwood 2009:92)

    "(Flowers et al., 2004; James, James, Jobard, Wong, & Gauthier, 2005; Garrett et al., 2000; Longcamp, Anton, Roth, & Velay, 2003)." (James and Atwood 2009:93)

    "there were a small number of regions that were actually category selective, indicating that this is not a typical response profile" (James and Atwood 2009:93)

    "that specialization for letters may reflect the sensorimotor integration that is required when we learn to write letters ( James & Gauthier, 2006; Longcamp et al., 2003)." (James and Atwood 2009:94)

    "recent work has shown that when participants view letters, a sensorimotor network becomes engaged ( James & Gauthier, 2006)." (James and Atwood 2009:94)

    "In addition, ventral visual areasspecifically, the left fusiform gyruswere engaged when participants wrote letters (without seeing them), but not when they drew shapes" (James and Atwood 2009:95)

    "coactivation of brain regions that process both visual and motor information during either perceptual or motor interaction with familiar letter stimuli was shown," (James and Atwood 2009:95)

    "We included testing in these training sessions to (a) assess whether or not the training had any effect from Day 1 to Day 2 and (b) to motivate the participants to learn the stimuli." (James and Atwood 2009:97)

    "a writing condition, a typing condition, or a visual condition." (James and Atwood 2009:98)

    "(4 seconds)" (James and Atwood 2009:98)

    "To localize regions of the brain that were engaged during letter processing, we performed a letters versus fixation contrast in the group data combined across the pretrain and posttrain scans" (James and Atwood 2009:100)

    "We demonstrate that after writing practice, some brain regions that are engaged during letter processing are also engaged more to trained pseudoletters than to untrained pseudoletters, implying that these regions increase their response to these particular stimuli only after a specific type of motor interaction" (James and Atwood 2009:107)

    "the regions that were found to change response as a result of writing training were the same regions as those found in previous work to respond during letter perception and during letter writing (the left fusiform gyrus and the left dorsal precentral gyrus; James & Gauthier, 2006)." (James and Atwood 2009:107)

    "no difference in performance in behavioural tasks as a function of different training conditions." (James and Atwood 2009:107)

    "This null behavioural result is in marked contrast to our significant differences in BOLD activation among training groups. Showing a difference in BOLD activation, but not a difference in behavioural measures, is not an uncommon pattern of results (e.g., see James & Gauthier, 2006; McLaughlin, Osterhout, & Kim, 2004; Wilkinson & Halligan, 2003a, 2003b)." (James and Atwood 2009:107)

    "after experience with certain types of stimuliin this case, pseudolettersbrain regions change their responses to the learned versus unlearned exemplars of that stimulus set" (James and Atwood 2009:108)

    "We would argue that the functional specialization that has been documented to letters (e.g., Flowers et al., 2004; Garrett et al., 2000; James et al., 2005) in the left ventral stream may be based partially on our motor experience with the stimuli." (James and Atwood 2009:108)

    "The present results support this general idea: that after motor experience, seeing a pseudoletter recruits areas of the brain that are specialized for letter processing, comprising a sensorimotor network" (James and Atwood 2009:108)

    "But what is it about writing experience that leads to this functional specialization?" (James and Atwood 2009:108)

    "Presumably, practised motor experiences set up representations of motor programmes in the frontal cortex, and these representations are activated upon subsequent visual presentation of the object" (James and Atwood 2009:108)

    "Efference copies of such information may project to the ventral visual processing stream, affecting neural activation in these regions. This process may facilitate recognition of the object by augmenting the visual information with sensorimotor information" (James and Atwood 2009:108)
