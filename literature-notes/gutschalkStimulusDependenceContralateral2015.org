#+title: Notes on Gutschalk, Steinmann, Stimulus Dependence of Contralateral Dominance in Human Auditory Cortex: Contralateral Dominance in Auditory Cortex

* general notes
** intro
In animals -  spiking activity is strongly contralateral in IC, and moderately-strong in AC

EEG and MEG in humans only moderately contralateral dominant
See also: Hine and Debener, 2007; Keonigs and Gutschalk, 2012;

Strong lateralization to the contralateral AC has been found in a number of fMRI studies using monaural stimulus presentation
See also: Langers et al., 2005; Scheonwiesner et al., 2007;

Also in human fMRI - considerably strong ipsilateral AC activation
See also: Devlin et al., 2003; Lehmann et al., 2007.

The importance of understanding contralateral dominance is e.g for understanding [[id:20221019T144900.589024][Right ear advanatge in dichotic listening]]

They try to reconcile the weak contralateral dominance found in MEG with the strong one found fMRI and animal models


*** methods

Long sequences - 32sec
Amplitude modulated white noise vs unmodulated
monaural

What is timing correction due to cardiac gating?

Clustered activated voxels and got pvalue based on monte-carlo simulation

They used just the contralateral monaural stimulus for auditory localization

What does
"BOLD time courses were reconstructed from the cortical data to separately estimate the contribution of transient and sustained BOLD components"
mean?

" Peak amplitudes of the transient onset response were measured in the time interval 2–14 s and average amplitudes of the sustained BOLD response were measured in the time interval 14–34 s after sound onset. "

We need to use a sound > silence contrast , where "sound" is left-monaural + right-monaural as the auditory localizer

*** results

***** brainstem
In the brainstem they found no difference between AM and UM noise, only a difference beween noise and silence

There was ipislateral dominance in the cochlear nucleus (duh), bilateral at the superior olivary complex ([[id:20221020T110952.527386][SOC]]), and contralateral at later stages - esp. In the inf. Colliculi ([[id:20221020T111200.383236][IC]]) and the MGB

Contralateral activity also beween SOC and IC (how did they measure activity between areas?)


***** auditory cortex
Contralateral activation in AC

An ipsilateral deactivation in lateral [[id:20221020T114257.720190][Herschel's convolution]] - but only for UN sounds

Because of that there's a slightly increased ipsilateral activation when contrasting AM vs noise

a previous report suggests that sustained BOLD
components are more strongly lateralized than the onset transient
See also: Lehmann et al., 2007

They calculate something called "lateralization index" - how?
***** discussion
Lateralization in AC in previous monaural fMRI studies is varied:
- strongly contralateral [see also: Langers et al., 2005; Scheffler et al., 1998]
-  50% or less contralateral [see also: Behne et al., 2005; Jeancke et al., 2002; Langers et al., 2007; Leh- mann et al., 2007; Suzuki et al., 2002; Woldorff et al., 1999]
- not significantly contralateral [see also: Devlin et al., 2003].

(Relevant to our analysis)
The degree of lateralization may be dependent on three factors:
First, the strongly lateralized sustained BOLD activity observed for sound-versus-silence contrasts, which is supposedly related to the fine structure of the carrier signal.
Second, the weakly lateralized transient onset response [Lehmann et al., 2007]. Third, the weakly lateralized sustained response to slow (AM) fluctuations.

Prominent differences in lateralization are accordingly expected in dependence on temporal stimulus characteristics, in particular temporal modulation and sound duration.

Previous studies of subcortical activation with monaural stimuli: all of them found strong contralateral activation in [[id:20221020T111200.383236][IC]] and [[id:20221020T140117.811499][MGB]], but different degrees of ipsilateral activation. In this study the didn't see any ipsilateral activation.
see also: Langers et al., 2005; Melcher et al., 2000; Scheonwiesner et al., 2007; Boyen et al., 2014

The lack of ipsilateral activation is in line with single unit studies in the IC of cat [see also: Delgutte et al., 1999; Semple and Aitkin, 1979] and gerbil [see also: Semple and Kitzes, 1985]. Based on these data, almost all IC neurons respond to contralateral sounds, whereas only 20% also respond to ipsilateral sounds and the response for ipsilateral stimulation is typically much weaker than for contralateral stimulation in these neurons [see also: Semple and Kitzes, 1985].

In monkeys (single unit recording) (see also: Reser et al., 2000):
layer III showes excitatory contralateral activation and inhibitory ipsilateral activation
supragranular layer shows ipsilateral activation
but layer III is the input layer from the thalamus, and the supragranular layer is more related for processing - so how does the information get to the supragranular layer on the ipsilateral side?

It has been shown that *sustained* fMRI activity in AC decreases strongly with rates of change above 20 Hz [see also: Giraud et al., 2000; Harms and Melcher, 2002; Overath et al., 2012], so for those situations the response is mainly the transient (=peak) res
I understand it to mean more than 20Hz of e.g tapping, not the freq of the soundwave

Subcortical sustained activity is not affected by the rate and remains high regardless



* summary and short reference

This paper contrasts the processing of unmodulated noise (UN) with amplitude modulated noise (AM) in human fMRI and MEG.
They look at the laterality of proccesing all along the pathway from the cochlear nucleus to the auditory cortex (AC).
They found that there was contralateral dominance in the parts of the pathway after the superior olivary complex esp. in the infirior colliculi, the MGB and the AC itself.


[[file:g:/My Drive/notes/slip-box/literature-notes/gutschalkStimulusDependenceContralateral2015.org_20221020_131754_LUq5Uy.png]]


They found a difference in the processing of UN and AM in the AC:  there was contralateral activation mostly for AM, while for UN there was  actually a moderate contralateral activation accompanied by ipsilateral /deactivation/.

Accordingly(?) They found contralateral activation for AM vs UN.
