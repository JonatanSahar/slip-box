#+TITLE: countering the illusionist perspective on consciousness

*** There's something really destabilizing about the ideas of illusionists: that the actual experience we're having is in fact an illusion, that the very experience of experiencing something is false in some way.
*** even if it's an illusion, the existence of that illusion - the experience of being fooled by it, what it produces, is undeniably real.
*** also - if the illusion is shared, and if I can anticipate the other's experience of his illusion (to some degree), and we build our world upon it - then what difference does it make?
