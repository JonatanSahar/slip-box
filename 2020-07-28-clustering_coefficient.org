#+TITLE: clustering coefficient
A measure of the degree to which nodes in a network tend to be interconnected in tight groups.
Defined as: (number of closed triplets)/(number of all triplets)

Or alternatively - the clustering coefficient *of a node* may be thought of as the
number of connections between all neighbors of that node, and the network
coefficient is then the average across all nodes.
