#+ROAM_ALIAS:
Is a a procedure done in epilepsy patients, where electrodes are inserted into/on the surface of the brain itslef.
Stimulating a processing area (like sight/hearing) creates effects in consciousness that match that area's function, while stimulating areas in the [[file:2021-05-20-pfc.org][PFC]] showed almost no effects on consciousness so far.
Current evidence (e.g cite:raccahDoesPrefrontalCortex2021) is in line with localist views (see [[file:2021-05-19-tocs.org][TOCs]]):

*** says PFC is least probable to be involved
*** unimodal regions have by far more ellicitation rates than frontal areas
* Challanges:
*** what if disrupting consciousness itself prevents you from reporting on it?
*** can we decide in advance what areas in the PFC may be susceptible to perturbation
***** maybe can find these areas from perception experiments
