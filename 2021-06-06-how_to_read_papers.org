#+TITLE: Reading thesis papers (how-to + ideas)


* general questions to keep in mind
- what are the prominent theories?
- what are the main areas of interest?
- what are the major questions?/ What is this paper asking about laterality in the AC?
- Who are the important researchers?
- What are the main methodologies?
- How is this question related to laterality in the AC?

* specific questions
- *my research question* is there a differece in AC  processing between ipsilateral and contralateral hand-ear cases?
- what is the effect of *action on perception* shown here?

* what do I want to know?
- laterality dominance:
    - in which parts of the pathway?
    - for what kinds of information? Is it different for e.g. Voice and music, or environmental sounds etc.
- what's the effect of producing a sound on:
    - the perception (experience) of that sound.
    - the processing (brain activity) of that sound.
- what else was done with MVPA in this area? Did anyone else try to decode something from AC activity?
