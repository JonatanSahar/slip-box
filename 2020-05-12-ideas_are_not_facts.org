#+TITLE: Idead are not facts
when using a [[file:20200507190139-zettelkasten.org][zettelkasten]] I don't have to put in it things that I necessarily
know to be *true*. It's meant to be a collection of ideas, and I can tag them in
a way that I will know where that idea came from. 
I don't need to be afraid to put stuff in there that I will later rely on, and
thus they must be true - it's a source of inspiration, it can hold bad ideas and conflicting ones too. 

It's hard for me to let go of the idea of summing up the information in an
article or lecture in a way that says: "this is what this author thinks about
this subject". I wonder if I should (let go of it).
